<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p>A few words may be proper in explanation of the objects
for which this book was written.</p>

<p>The forms which quackery assumes are endless; but the
material out of which they are evolved is essentially the same
in all ages and in all countries. There are certain medical
errors which are common to man everywhere and in every condition.
It is these which constitute the material of quackery,
whether it appear among the savage or the civilized, the rude
or the refined, the illiterate or the learned. One object of this
book is to develop these fundamental errors, and to show the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i> by which the genius of imposture has produced
from them the fantastic and ever-changing shapes of empiricism.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
I notice particularly some of the specific forms of
quackery which are now prevalent, not because they differ
essentially from those which have preceded them, but because
they have a <em>present</em> interest to the reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span></p>

<p>One of the objects at which I aim is to expose to the public
the fallacy of those sources of evidence, upon which they rely
in estimating the comparative merits of physicians, and to show
them what tests they have at command, which will not prove
fallacious. The proper use of these tests would save the public
from mistaking, as they now often do, the plausible pretensions
of the superficial practitioner, and the charlatan, for the evidences
of real skill and wisdom.</p>

<p>Another object will be to present the claims of the medical
profession to the respect and the confidence of the community.
As it now is, the profession stands in a somewhat false position
before the public. The grounds upon which we ask their
regard and trust are not generally understood. The confidence
which is reposed in us is not as intelligent as it should be. It
is unsettled and capricious. It is overweening at one time, and
it is entirely withheld at another, and for the most frivolous
reasons. The inconsistencies of even the well informed on this
subject are surprising. Many, who on some occasions confide
implicitly in nothing but educated science, are found at other
times submitting themselves and their families to the haphazard
administrations of empiricism.</p>

<p>But while I attempt to establish the claims of the medical
profession to the confidence of the people, and to defend it
against the aspersions which are unjustly cast upon it, I endeavor
to exhibit faithfully the abuses which exist in the profession
itself. The quackery which is practised among medical men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
is a much greater evil than that which is abroad in the community.
I attack it therefore with an unsparing hand. In so
doing I expose many of the tricks and manœuvres which are
employed by those physicians, who, pursuing medicine as a
<em>trade</em> instead of a profession, study the science of patient-getting
to the neglect of the science of patient-curing. When the
rules of an honorable professional intercourse shall come to be
properly understood and appreciated by the public, one of the
great sources of the success of quackery will be removed.</p>

<p>In exposing the errors and faults of the medical profession
and of the public, while I have unflinchingly aimed at the truth
I have endeavored to avoid a censorious spirit, and to give to
human frailty all the tolerance that can properly be demanded.
I trust the reader will therefore find, that, in the language of
my motto, “there are no wasps, there are no hornets here.”
That I have escaped all error myself I do not claim. Some
points may be too strongly stated, and some provisionary and
modifying considerations may be omitted. I ask of the reader
a reasonable indulgence, but none which shall be inconsistent
with an honest and candid criticism.</p>

<p>In the practice of medicine there are some points upon
which there should be a common understanding between the
physician and the friends and attendants of the sick. From the
want of such an understanding the purposes and plans of the
practitioner are often interfered with, and sometimes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
effectually thwarted. A considerable portion therefore of this
work is devoted to an elucidation of the points referred to.</p>

<p>In the chapter on the uncertainty of medicine, and in other
places, also, I point out the difficulties which are encountered
in the study and practice of medicine. These difficulties demand
of the physician the exercise of higher and more cultivated
powers, than are needed for the successful prosecution of
most other studies and pursuits. I therefore make it a principal
object to urge, by every consideration, the importance of a
well-educated medical profession. Every man has a personal
interest in maintaining the barriers by which the organizations
of the profession undertake to protect the community from the
evils, which they would suffer from ignorance and imposture, if
these barriers were destroyed. It is especially for the advantage
of the <em>people</em>, and not, as is commonly supposed, of physicians,
that there should be a proper standard of medical
education.</p>

<p>My first chapter, on the uncertainty of medicine, may perhaps
be considered by some as too strictly professional for the
common reader. I ask for it, however, a careful perusal. I
have endeavored to strip the subject of all technicalities, and a
full understanding of the views there presented is necessary to
a proper appreciation of the considerations contained in some of
the succeeding chapters.</p>

<p>I write in part for the profession, and in part for the community
at large. I ask both to look candidly at the views<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
which I present of their ‘<em>mutual duties, relations, and
interests</em>.’ A reform is needed in the opinions and practices
both of physicians, and of the people, in regard to medical subjects.
This reform is fairly begun in the profession, and there
may be seen, even amid all the present diversified and flaunting
displays of quackery, some indications of its commencement in
the community. The volume which I now offer to the public
is a humble effort to promote this reform.</p>

</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>False estimate of the importance of <em>positive</em> medication. This error
appears in various ways. Healing of wounds—anointed axe. Attributing
effects to agencies just preceding them—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post hoc propter hoc</i> mode of
reasoning. Referring the cure of a case to some <em>one</em> remedy or measure,
when commonly the result of many. Disposition to have something
done all the time. Disease considered often as a palpable thing—a
humor—a poison—medicines supposed to neutralize it. Specifics. Supposed
to be many—really few, if any. Definition. Inadequate ideas of the
community of the necessity for discrimination in medical practice. Propensity
to look for some universal catholicon. Disease supposed by some
to be an unit. A sort of universality of operation attributed to favorite
remedies, even sometimes among physicians. Dr. Beddoes’ gases. Physicians
<em>correct</em> their errors by experience—the public only exchange one
error for another in medicine. Changes in popular opinion in regard to
quack remedies.</p>

<p style="float: left;">QUACKERY,</p>
<p style="float: right;"><a href="#Page_80">80</a></p>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>The grand source of quackery the false reference of effects to causes.
The way in which a remedy, whether active or inert, acquires its reputation.
Quack medicines principally of <em>three</em> kinds. 1. Evacuants. Great
similarity in these—made up mostly of articles in common use. 2. Those
which are supposed to act upon the system in a gradual way, as alternatives.
Preparations of sarsaparilla. Impositions. 3. Those which are
supposed to act especially upon the lungs. Harm done by their indiscriminate
use. Quantities of inert and damaged articles used in preparing
quack medicines. Importance of the <em>name</em> of a medicine in giving it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
currency. Ridiculousness of quack advertisements. Certificates. Chiefly
of <em>four</em> kinds. 1. Forgeries. 2. Essentially, sometimes wholly, untrue.
How obtained. 3. Those given by invalids imagining themselves to be
relieved. 4. Those given by invalids who are relieved while taking the
medicine—inferred to be done <em>by</em> the medicine. Certificates of clergymen.
Rule of the medical profession in regard to nostrums. Proposed
mode of guarding against imposition. Quackery as a monstrous business
interest. Press and legislatures trammelled by it. Itinerant quack lecturers.
Lectures especially to the ladies. Animal magnetism. Paracelsus
the “prince of quacks.” St. John Long. Perkins’ tractors.
Forms of Quackery many, but the materials from which they are formed
always the same. No discoveries have ever been made by quackery.</p>

<p style="float: left;">THOMPSONISM,</p>
<p style="float: right;"><a href="#Page_103">103</a></p>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<p>Principles of the system as promulgated by its founder. Bold confidence
of Thompson in his mode of practice. Points in his theory. Obstructed
perspiration. Strife between the heat and the cold. Simplicity
of the system. No need of “learned doctors.” Thompsonian views of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i> of medicines. Radicalism of Thompsonism. Prejudice
against mineral medicines. No article injurious simply <em>because</em> it
is mineral. The most deadly poisons in nature vegetable. Effects of
vegetable poisons generally as abiding as those of mineral. Lobelia a
poison, sometimes fatal, though Thompsonians claim it to be perfectly
harmless. Definition of <em>poison</em>. Some poisons more rapid than others in
their effects. Poison sometimes used in a relative sense. This word one
of the watch-words of Thompsonians, though they daily use poisons as
common articles of food. Changes in Thompsonian practice since the
system was first promulgated.</p>

<p style="float: left;">HOMŒOPATHY,</p>
<p style="float: right;"><a href="#Page_120">120</a></p>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<p>Brief notice of the founder of Homœopathy. His exalted ideas of his
“discovery.” Two principles in his theory. 1. <em>Like cures like.</em> According
to Hahneman there are three modes of practice—allopathic, antipathic,
homœopathic. The last alone truly successful, according to him.
The name allopath wrongly bestowed by Hahneman upon physicians.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
2. <em>Minute division, with agitation and trituration, communicates a new
power to medicines.</em> Subdivision very minute, and extremely particular
directions given by Hahneman for effecting it. Whether such a power
is thus communicated to be decided by facts. “Observations” on which
the opinion is founded. Character of them illustrated from Jahr’s manual.
Their extreme minuteness. Mode of collecting them. Based
upon the ridiculous idea that all states of the body are to be referred to
the remedy taken. Notices of some particular remedies in illustration.
Alleged success of Homœopathy. <em>Apparent</em> success to be attributed to
six causes. 1. Mental influence. 2. A strict regard to diet and regimen.
3. Operation of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix naturæ</i>, or curative power of nature.
4. Comparisons made between the results of homœopathic practice and
those of over-dosing physicians. 5. An occasional stealthy use of remedies
in ordinary doses. 6. The facility with which people are deceived in
regard to comparative results. Parallel case of a German clergyman.
Empty boasts of homœopathists as to the character of their physicians.
Points of resemblance and of difference between Thompsonism and
Homœopathy.</p>

<p style="float: left;">NATURAL BONE-SETTERS,</p>
<p style="float: right;"><a href="#Page_146">146</a></p>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>Setting of bones wholly mechanical. There cannot be an <em>innate</em>
skill in this, any more than there can be in any other kind of mechanics.
Explanation of bone-setting. Skill obtained in this just as in anything
else. Bone-setter <em>learns</em> all that he actually knows, by his own observation,
and from others. It is not <em>born</em> with him. Gets some of his
knowledge by stealth. <em>Errors committed by natural bone-setters.</em> Supposing
a fracture to be a dislocation. Injuries of joints in which there is
neither dislocation nor fracture—harm sometimes done in such cases by
the bone-setter. Failure in the <em>medical</em> part of the treatment in some
cases. Failure in the management of fractures. Physicians not all good
bone-setters. Mechanical tact requisite. Though so many cases of mal-practice
can be found among the patients of natural bone-setters, generally
supposed by the community to be infallible. Difficulty in getting a
verdict of damages against them. <em>Reasons why they, in spite of their
errors, acquire a reputation for skill.</em> Setting sprains. Facility of the
imposition practised. Breaking up old adhesions. Stiff joints and contracted
tendons—efficacy of rubbing. Imagined tenderness and inability
of motion. Sub-luxations—random pulling. False reports of cases.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span></p>

<p style="float: left;">GOOD AND BAD PRACTICE,</p>
<p style="float: right;"><a href="#Page_172">172</a></p>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>Not easy to distinguish between good and bad practice by results. If
it were, would not be such differences of opinion among physicians and
in the community. Examples of these differences. Stimulating and
depleting measures. Homœopathy, Hydropathy, Thompsonism. Quacks
aware of the difficulty in estimating comparative results—act accordingly.
No mode of practice wholly good—none wholly bad. Some good
points in all modes. Exclusive systems. Distinctions between good and
bad practice pointed out. Cases in which the question of life and death
immediately affected by practice. Failure of unskilfulness in such cases.
Interesting case. Seldom is the influence of bad practice so manifest as
in this case. Difficulty of culling out from the mass cases which are dangerous
from the first. Various causes of this. Difficulty inherent. Cases
misrepresented by mistake or wilfully. Some said to be <em>very sick</em> when
not so. Light cases made bad by treatment—though appear grave, apt to
recover. Illustrations. Comparisons between rival physicians as to results.
Public often mistake in such comparisons. Notice some less direct effects of
bad practice. Unnecessary complications of disease. State of system
after recovery. General state of health in families. Length of sickness.
Summing up of differences in results between good and bad practice.
Two requisites for observing these correctly. 1. Sufficient amount of
evidence. 2. Skill in observation. Community deficient in these. Confident
appeals of quacks to alleged results. Show what the physician
should say in regard to results.</p>

<p style="float: left;">THEORY AND OBSERVATION,</p>
<p style="float: right;"><a href="#Page_200">200</a></p>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>All real knowledge based upon observation, not on theory. Facts of
two kinds—individual and general. General facts ascertained by observation
of many individual or particular facts. No theory founded on facts—always
goes beyond them. No science in which there has been so
much theorizing as in medicine. History of medicine very much a history
of theories. Office of theory—<em>suggestive</em>. Abuse of theory in failing
to distinguish between the known and the supposed. Newton’s carefulness
on this point. Circumstances impairing skill in observation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
Mode of reviewing cases. Disposition to form conclusions from a limited
range of facts. Young practitioners. Dr. Sewall’s plates. Dr. Sutton’s
treatment of delirium tremens. Different theories of fever—Boerhaave,
Cullen, Clutterbuck, Broussais, Cooke, Samuel Thompson. Hobby-riding.
Diseases of the throat and windpipe. Habit of making loose and exaggerated
statements. Credulity and fondness for novelty and change.
Changeable state of medicine. No standard <em>authorities</em> as in law and
theology. Scepticism in medicine. <em>Easy to theorize—difficult to observe
well.</em> Value of good habits of observation. Medical men had too much
to do with theories and modes and systems. Eclecticism. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Modus operandi</i>
of medicines. A reform in progress in medicine. Breaking loose from
theory. Promoting rigid observation.</p>

<p>No class of men so erroneously estimated as physicians. Object of this
chapter to show how the community can judge of them correctly.
Education of physicians—evidences of it. Medical education practically
despised by a large portion of the public. Standing of medical man
among his brethren criterion of merit. Difficulty in getting their unbiased
opinions. Certain mental qualities essential to skill in the
practice of medicine. How the common observer can detect and measure
these qualities. <em>Observe them as exhibited in regard to subjects which he
understands in common with the physician.</em> Illustration from surgery.
Illustrations of same truth in relation to various characteristics of medical
men. Formation of opinions—credulous—sceptical—hasty and changeable—cautious
and tenacious—strong and ardent. How can test one’s
habits of observation. Asking many questions no sure proof of accurate
and minute observation. Enquiries of different physicians about an
article of curiosity. Same rule for judging of the <em>measures</em> of the physician,
as we have applied to his opinions. A genius in medicine. Innate
skill. Rules which have been pointed out for estimating comparative
merits of physicians not in common use with the public. A change
necessary in this respect. Cannot easily be effected. Many physicians
would be opposed to such a change—would rather false tests continue to
be applied. But the change can be effected.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</span></p>

<p>The credulous, ignorant, and novelty-seeking, not the only persons imposed
upon by quackery. Many of the judicious and intelligent also.
Efforts to undeceive the public on this subject have been often faulty.
Too much reliance on popular knowledge of anatomy, physiology,
dietetics, &amp;c. This should only be auxiliary to other means. Relied
upon alone, leads to error. Individual influence of physicians in showing
their friends their mistakes in connecting cause and effect in medicine.
This influence to be exerted upon the intelligent who uphold
quackery. Too much sarcasm and ridicule and invective used against
quackery. Credulity of the public takes a license from that of medical
men. Certificates of physicians in favor of nostrums. Secret medicines
put forth by physicians. Spirit of quackery in the medical profession.
Exhibited in various ways. Quite prevalent, crippling the profession in
its warfare with empiricism. Reform needed. Can be effected. The
stable and intelligent can help in effecting it, by promoting medical education—by
sustaining the organizations of the profession—by renouncing
fallacious means of estimating professional merit—by favoring strict observance
of the rules of intercourse among physicians. Formation of the
American Medical Association, an important movement in the destruction
of quackery.</p>

indestructible. Manifestations of mind connected with and dependent
upon the material organization. Brain in some sense seat of mind—central

Other subordinate nervous centres. Bichat’s idea of the seat of the moral
sentiments. Weakness of mind in sickness. Slight causes affect it
strongly. Importance of quiet in sick room. Difficult to secure it. Visitors.
Conversation. Children as easily disturbed as adults. Holding up
physician as a bugbear to them. Exciting the mind commonly irritates
bodily disease, whether in the brain, or in some other organ. Death of
Hunter caused by a fit of passion. Duty of physician sometimes to excite

<p>Physician’s employment a cheerful one. Contrary opinion quite prevalent,
but erroneous. Cases in which he can neither cure nor palliate few.
Prevailing cast of physician’s mind, therefore, hopeful. Hope should always
be based on intelligent grounds. Hope in the different stages of a
case. Seldom should all hope be given up—even in apparently desperate
cases recovery sometimes occurs. Interesting case. Hope a cordial—as
necessary as the cordial draught, and as improper to withhold it. Giving
false <em>assurances</em> wrong. Often done by quacks and quackish physicians.
Views and feelings of patients in regard to prospect of death often misunderstood.
Extinction of all hope of recovery not commonly desirable in
cases certain to be fatal. This extinction of hope not essential to perfect
resignation. Influence of collateral circumstances upon the manner in
which death is met. Occasional pauses in the onward progress of fatal
chronic disease. Duty of the physician in regard to the hope awakened at
such times. Supposed salutary moral influence of the certain expectation
of death. Tendency to hope in consumptive patients. Curability of

Deception as commonly practised generally fails to be carried out. Case
of the deceived child. 3. The discovery of the deception, when it takes
place, has a worse effect on the patient than a full statement of the truth
could produce. 4. Destruction of confidence occasioned by discovered deception
injurious to the persons deceived. Children. The insane. Detected
deception not only increases insanity, but modifies it. 5. <em>General</em>
effect of deception, extending beyond the individual on whom it is practised.
General distrust of the veracity of physicians. 6. If adopted as a
common rule that deception is sometimes proper, the object of the deception
would be defeated. 7. If the door for deception be once opened there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</span>

<span class="fs80">UNCERTAINTY OF MEDICINE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The uncertainty of medicine is a common topic in all
circles; and yet it is one which is very generally misunderstood,
even by the intelligent and reflecting in the community.
They mistake as to the nature of this uncertainty,
its causes, its practical influence in the treatment of disease,
the means which should be resorted to in order to diminish
it, and the best methods of guarding against the
errors into which it is liable to lead us. These errors are,
I may remark, so numerous and so common, and interfere
so constantly with the usefulness of the physician among
high and low, educated and uneducated, almost equally,
that the subject is one of vast practical importance. It
is important not only to physicians, but to the people, and
to the people especially, for <em>they</em> are the sufferers from the
multiform and often fatal injuries, which these errors engender.</p>

<p>It will be profitable then to examine the different points
to which I have alluded, so that it may be seen how far
the science of medicine merits confidence, and by what
tests an intelligent and thinking man may distinguish between
that which rests upon good and substantial evidence,
and that which is uncertain and delusive. This is a distinction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
which often fails to be made, (as the physician has
occasion every day to lament,) by the shrewd and learned,
as well as the ignorant and unwary; and the deductions of
a rational and careful experience are continually confounded
with the false assumptions, and plausible fallacies
of the mere pretender, and the fanciful vagaries of the enthusiast.
So far as my remarks will enable the reader to
make the distinction to which I have referred, just so far
will my object be accomplished.</p>

<p>When the chemist mixes substances together, the composition
of which he knows, he arrives at results which
may be strictly denominated certain and invariable. If he
be not able to do this at once, he can do so ultimately, by a
series of experiments, varied to test each doubtful point.
The results which he thus obtains are so exact, that they
can be expressed by numbers and definite proportions.
The physician can imitate the chemist, it is true, in the application
of tests in the investigation of disease; but it is
necessarily a very humble and distant imitation, and no
approach to the certainty and definiteness of chemical
analysis and synthesis can be expected in medical practice.
When the chemist mixes substances together, he knows
what they are; and when he sees their effect upon each
other, he has a right to expect the same effect to follow,
with absolute certainty, whenever he shall make the same
mixture again. But the physician cannot infer from the
effect of a remedy in one case, that the same result will
certainly occur in another case which appears to be precisely
similar. For he cannot know enough of the circumstances
of the two cases, to determine beyond a doubt that
they are exactly alike. There are often causes, utterly undiscoverable
by human wisdom, which essentially modify
the effects of remedies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>If you suppose that the chemist knows the nature of only
a part of the substances which he puts into his retort,—that
the retort itself is made of materials which will act upon
these substances, and be acted upon by them, and that in
the midst of his experiment some other substance is introduced
accidentally or by stealth, producing an entire change
in the process; you will then make the chemist to resemble
the physician in the uncertainty of his results. He
would then be obliged, as the physician is, to go through
with a great many observations to establish any one fact;
and instead of making, as he now does, a well-defined line
of separation between what is known and what is not
known, he would, like the physician, have a wide middle
ground of probability and supposition.</p>

<p>The causes which make disease complicated, and prevent
uniformity in the effects of remedies, are principally
these, viz.:</p>

<p>1. The sympathy which exists between the different organs
of the body.</p>

<p>2. The influence of unseen causes or agents.</p>

<p>3. Natural changes, arising from the tendency which
exists in the system to throw off disease, appropriately called
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix naturæ</i>, or restoring power of nature;
and in connection with this the tendency to a definite
limit manifest in many diseases; for example, small
pox, whooping cough, measles, scarlet fever, &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. Mental influences.</p>

<p>5. Idiosyncrasies, or individual peculiarities.</p>

<p>We will examine in a familiar way each class of these
causes separately.</p>

<p>1. The sympathy which exists between the different organs
of the body.</p>

<p>The fact that when one organ is disordered in any way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
other organs sympathize, or suffer with it, is familiar to every
one. This sympathy destroys the simplicity of disease,
in two ways. In the first place, it produces many symptoms
at a distance from the organ affected. Pain, for example,
is often far away from the disease which causes it.
The pain in the right shoulder from disease of the liver, in
the knee from disease of the hip joint, and in the head from
disordered stomach, are familiar instances. Convulsions,
in the great majority of cases, especially in children, are a
mere symptom developed by the sympathy of the brain and
nervous system with disease in some other organ—for example,
a disordered stomach, the irritation of teething, &amp;c.
Now if sympathy renders disease complex, by developing
such marked symptoms as those we have mentioned, at a
distance from the affected organ, much more will it do this
by the numerous less observable, and less definite symptoms,
attendant upon our various bodily maladies.</p>

<p>In the second place, sympathy destroys the simplicity of
disease, not only by exciting symptoms in organs at a distance
from the part affected, but also by creating actual
disease in those organs. A single example will suffice.
The child, whose brain sympathizes with the disease in its
stomach, may have inflammation after a time fastened upon
its brain in consequence of this sympathy, the symptoms at
first being obscure, but at length clear and unequivocal.</p>

<p>The influence of sympathy in modifying disease occasions
constantly much perplexity in the mind of the physician.
He often finds it difficult, and sometimes impossible,
to decide whether an organ, which he sees to be affected,
is really diseased, or is merely sympathizing with some
other organ.</p>

<p>The simplicity of disease is thus destroyed by sympathy,
even when all the organs, except the one which is attacked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
are in a healthy state at the time of the attack. And when
they are already in an unhealthy, unnatural condition from
previous disease, the complication is rendered still greater.
<em>Chronic</em><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> cases especially are often so complex from this
cause, that it requires the most discriminating acumen to
unravel their history, and make out the starting point of the
disease. Often it is impossible to discover any such starting
point; and sometimes there is none, but there are several
different diseases in different organs, all affecting each
other through sympathy, and presenting together a confused
and changing medley of symptoms. In such cases, the
manifestations of diseased action are at one time most prominent
in one organ, and at another time in another. These
variations in the phase of the disease are often so unaccountable,
as to seem capricious, and they always embarrass
the physician, as he attempts to determine the effect
of his remedies, and to proportion them to the importance
of the symptoms, as they show themselves in the various
organs. It would sometimes almost seem, that a tricksy
little spirit were playing its pranks among the organs, now
here and now there, eluding his search, and escaping his
grasp.</p>

<p>In some cases, disease will leave the organ in which it
seems to be obstinately fixed, and appear in full force in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
some other organ, which has been up to that time only
sympathetically affected. This is more apt to occur in
children, because the sympathies are more lively in them
than they are in adults. Such changes, taking place often
without any obvious cause, and so suddenly, and sometimes,
we may add, so secretly, you can readily see, must
tend to make our knowledge of disease, and of the effect of
remedies, confused and uncertain.</p>

<p>2. The influence of unseen or secret causes, is another
source of uncertainty in medicine.</p>

<p>The fact, that some causes, whose nature and extent
cannot be appreciated, are at work modifying disease, and
the effects of remedies, constantly forces itself upon the attention
of the practitioner. The causes of disease, and of
the changes that occur during its progress, are much more
concealed from our view than is generally supposed. Patients
are fond of fixing upon something to which they can
attribute their sickness; but in the great majority of cases,
the conclusion which they adopt with so much confidence
is a mere supposition, and does not rest upon any substantial
proofs. Even in the case of a common cold, you will
find that the reasons given for believing that this or that
cause produced it, often will not bear a strict examination,
according to the acknowledged rules of evidence. Ordinarily
some exposure is looked upon as being without a doubt the
cause, when it may have been only one of the causes, or may
even have had no agency at all in producing the result.</p>

<p>Some of the causes of disease, though, from their definite
and invariable results, we may be perfectly aware of
their presence, are yet of an occult nature, escaping all
the tests devised to detect them. For instance, the miasm,
as it is termed, which is the cause of intermittent fever,
has never yet been detected in the atmosphere, by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
application of any chemical test. And yet, no result in
the wide range of disease is more definite and palpable
than that which this miasm produces. And so secretly
does it make its impression, that the disease sometimes lies
dormant for a long period, even for weeks and months—the
system all the while showing no signs of its presence. I
once had a case of intermittent fever, which was not
developed till a year had elapsed from the time of the
patient’s exposure to the cause.</p>

<p>The nature and mode of operation of the causes of
many diseases are involved in mystery, and are subjects
of discussion and dispute among medical men. The
formidable, and often fatal malady, that results from a
wound received in dissection, is attributed by some to a
poison evolved in the decomposition of the body; while
others suppose that it arises from the irritation of the
wound simply, circumstances concurring to increase the
irritation in one case, while it is left to subside in others.
It is agreed, on all hands, that the contingencies on which
the disease depends are not ascertained; and they are so
often absent, that the cases in which the malady does
actually occur bear a very small proportion to the whole
number of instances in which such a wound is received.</p>

<p>The same may be substantially said of the causes of
typhus fever, cholera, scarlatina, &amp;c. Some think that
these diseases are caused by subtle poisons, which enter
the system in various supposed ways; while others believe
that they arise from causes which make <em>impressions</em>
merely upon the system, and thus awaken trains of morbid
action. Whatever may be our opinion on these disputed
points, the fact that there is so much secrecy in the
operation of morbific influences, must, it is clear, make
much of our knowledge of disease uncertain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>If, then, there be so much ground for difference of
opinion in regard to the nature of the causes of disease,
and their mode of operation, where the results are of so
definite a character, as we see in the disorders to which
I have alluded; much more is this the case with those
diseases, which, with their Protean shapes, make up a large
proportion of the maladies that call for the daily attention
of the physician. <em>These</em> do not commonly spring from
one cause, but from many causes concurring together,
some of which may be ascertained, while others are only
suspected, or are wholly concealed from the most scrutinizing
investigation. Under these circumstances, the physician
has a difficult task to discover the actual condition of
the patient. It would be a comparatively easy one, if he
knew what all the agents were that had combined to produce
the disease, even though they were numerous and
complicated in their operation. He could then thread out
with some success, the trains of morbid action, and, perhaps,
give to each cause its proper place in his estimate of
their agency in causing the disease. But, in some cases,
he knows but little of the nature and mode of action, even
of those agents, whose influence he can perceive: and
then, there are some quite as important, which act in entire
secrecy, developing results that cannot be foreseen, and
that cannot be calculated upon after they have made their
appearance. Such developments are often observed in
the progress of disease, and necessarily embarrass us in
its treatment. They sometimes completely alter, either
gradually or suddenly, the whole character of the case;
and yet they may be the consequences of causes, which
have been secretly, but surely, doing their work from the
first onset of the disease. In some cases, which were in
the commencement comparatively mild, a group of severe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
symptoms all at once start up, exciting astonishment and
alarm in the mind of the practitioner. Sometimes there
are precursors of the full development, half showing themselves,
and the watchful physician may discover in them
the coming storm, long before the indications are manifest
to the common observer. Even after convalescence has,
to all appearance, fairly begun, and the symptoms seen
during the progress of the disease are gone, some new
symptoms may appear—the upshot of a train of morbid
influences, which had been all the while imperceptibly
advancing to this result; just as I have seen a fire, supposed
to be extinguished, burst forth like a new fire in another
part of the building, to which it had secretly made its way.</p>

<p>It is sometimes impossible to detect the immediate cause
of an attack of sickness, even when the transition from
health to disease is apparently instantaneous. Take, for
example, this case. A gentleman, while quietly sitting in
his counting-room, was attacked, as suddenly as if it were
from a blow, with a great sense of oppression in the region
of the heart, almost arresting the action of this organ, and
at once prostrating his strength. No reason could be discovered
why this attack should occur at that time rather
than at some other. And yet there was some hidden
cause, or combination of causes, which, at that moment,
did its work; and we know not how long a time a preparation
had been going on for this consummation, and so
silently, too, as to occasion no disturbance.</p>

<p>The physician often finds, on making his first call upon
a patient, that although he may think that his attack is
only a thing of to-day, there is evidence that disease must
have been preying upon his system for some length of
time, gradually extending its ravages, till, at length, it has
made a palpable outbreak. The patient may attribute his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
sickness to some one cause; but there have been many
causes uniting together, one after another, and swelling
the still current of disease, which has now broken forth as
a flood.</p>

<p>And, as a general rule, the longer this preparation has
been going on, the more obstinate does the physician
expect the case will be, and the more difficulty does he find
in getting a definite knowledge of the nature and extent
of the malady. And if he could always trace every train
of disease up to all its sources, both original and tributary,
he would often be obliged to go back weeks, months, and
sometimes years. In some cases, such an exploration
would lead him through almost endless labyrinths. As it
is, he often finds, in attempting such a search, that those
facts which are the least material in the eyes of the patient,
and which may be overlooked by him in giving the history
of his case, reveal, far back in the distance, causes which
have had more influence than any other in producing this
result. A sort of cross-questioning, and that sometimes
of a rigid character, is often needed, to develop material
facts. The patient’s own story, without such questioning,
would generally give to the physician very erroneous ideas
of his case.</p>

<p>The remarks that I have made apply with greater force
to chronic than they do to acute diseases. For in them
more especially, as you have already seen, does the sympathy
which exists between the different organs extend
and complicate the morbid condition, and the operation of
unseen causes contributes, sometimes very largely, to this
result.</p>

<p>Many chronic cases become exceedingly complex, and
therefore obstinate, from the course which the patient
takes with himself, before he comes under regular and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
systematic treatment. Perhaps, first, he goes through with
domestic medication, and then takes patent medicines,
recommended to him by kind neighbors, or blazoned forth
in the newspapers. Then he tries some vaunted system—Thompsonism,
or hydropathy, or homœopathy, or chrono-thermalism,
or perhaps all of them in succession. After
going through all this, unless some one of these measures
<em>chance</em> to benefit his case, (as <em>anything</em> may <em>chance</em> to do
it), he at last comes to a physician, and puts himself under
his care. The case which was, perhaps, sufficiently complicated
in the beginning to require strict investigation, is
now rendered, by all this variety of practice, very intricate.
The difficulty in understanding it lies in the varied
effects which the different agents brought to bear on it
have produced—effects, which, in the retrospect, it is almost
impossible to estimate with any correctness, because the
physician has only the history given him by the patient,
and the appearance of his present symptoms, to guide him
in making up his opinions. If he had himself seen the
case in its untouched condition, and then had witnessed
the operation of the different remedies, he would have
been better able to arrive at satisfactory conclusions.
A chronic case, in its best estate, needs to be watched for
some little time, in order to acquire a just and thorough
knowledge of its character. And when it has gone
through a series of processes at <em>haphazard</em>, with no intelligent
eye to observe it, it is no wonder that its condition
should become a complicated and puzzling one. The physician,
with such a case before him, is situated very much
as the chemist would be, into whose hands should be put a
mixture which had been experimented upon over and
over again by different chemists, and those, too, who were
ignorant and bungling. And as you would not demand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
of him, that he should arrive at once at definite results in
examining the composition of such a mixture, but would
give him time to apply various tests to it, so it should not
be expected of the physician that he should fully understand
at once a case which has been dabbled with by ignorant
experimenters, one after another; but time must be
given him to watch <em>his</em> tests, that he may see them bring
out to view its real character and condition.</p>

<p>It must be obvious to the reader, that those who go
through this round of experimenting, before they put themselves
under the care of an intelligent physician, not only
lose valuable time by so doing, but generally inflict upon
themselves positive harm. The remedies which they have
used, if they have had no good effect, have helped to
<em>fasten</em> the disease upon the system, and have increased its
severity. They have done this by irritating the system,
and, of course, the diseased organs, and by extending the
complaint far beyond its original limits. You have seen
that, through the sympathy existing between different
organs, disease becomes extended and complicated. Well-directed
treatment has a tendency to prevent this extension
of disease: mere blind experimenting, on the other
hand, is apt to promote it; and if it does not have this
effect, the patient is very fortunate.</p>

<p>3. I pass now to the consideration of the third class of
causes which render medicine an uncertain science, viz.,
natural changes, arising from the tendency which exists in
the system to throw off disease, appropriately called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis
medicatrix naturæ</i>, or curative power of nature; and, in
connection with this, the tendency to a definite limit,
which is manifest in many diseases, as, for example, small
pox, measles, hooping cough, scarlet fever, &amp;c.</p>

<p>To recur to our chemical illustration. I have said that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
it would add vastly to the uncertainty of the results of the
chemist’s experiments, if the retort, into which he puts his
substances to be experimented upon, could itself act upon
these substances, and thus modify their action upon each
other. The body of the patient may be considered as the
physician’s retort, and the diseases and the remedies introduced,
as the materials contained in it. Under this head
we are to examine certain principles which reside in this
retort, and which have a constant and important influence
upon diseases and their remedies, modifying, sometimes manifestly,
and sometimes secretly, their action upon each other.</p>

<p>I will speak first of the tendency to throw off disease, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix naturæ</i>. I need not spend time in proving
to you the existence of such a tendency. It requires not
the exercise of any scientific acumen to discover it. It
is obvious to the most superficial observer. And yet the
extent to which it operates is far from being properly
appreciated, even by medical men; and much less is it by
those who are out of the profession. The changes which
it produces are constantly confounded with the effects of
remedies; and this is one of the chief sources of the
errors which encumber the annals of medical experience.</p>

<p>The reader will see, as we proceed, that boast as doctors
often will of <em>their</em> cures, as if they were wholly theirs, this
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix naturæ</i> is the chief doctor after all; and
she, good, kind angel, hovering over the bed of sickness,
without fee, and often without even any acknowledgment
of her services, saves the life of many a poor patient, who
is near being drugged to death by some ignorant quack, or
some over-dosing doctor.</p>

<p>That the reader may be somewhat acquainted with the
extent of the influence which this curative principle exerts,
I will cite some examples of its operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>If some offending substance be present in the stomach,
vomiting is produced, the substance is evacuated, and
this organ, having thus relieved itself by an effort of
nature, as it is commonly expressed, now goes on with the
performance of its usual functions. In this case, the
ordinary action of the organ is entirely reversed, in obedience
to the curative principle. If an attempt be made to
allay the vomiting before the offending substance is thrown
off, it is an injurious interference with a salutary effort.
Sometimes the effort is ineffectual, and needs the assistance
of art. It is often difficult to decide whether vomiting is
prompted by this curative principle, or is caused by irritation,
which should be quieted by medicine. Want of due
discrimination, either from lack of knowledge, or from
carelessness, very often leads to errors on this point.</p>

<p>The operation of this principle is beautifully exhibited
in the succession of the processes of inflammation. You
see a swelling. It, after a while, begins to soften. There
is matter in it, but it is not yet very near the surface.
But soon, at some point, it comes nearer and nearer to
the surface, the wall of the abscess thus becoming constantly
more thin, till, at length, it opens and discharges.
The discharge continues till the swelling is nearly all gone,
and the remainder is absorbed, and the part is restored to
its natural state.</p>

<p>Now, this is quite a series of processes, all contributing
to one result, and it is presided over, or directed, by the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix naturæ</i>. The object of this series is a
definite one; and each process does its part in effecting it,
and does it commonly at the right time, and in the
right manner. Just look for a moment at the complicated
character of this apparently simple operation. Here is
quite a large deposition of substance which is to be removed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
and this is the object to be effected. Observe how it is
done. The softening of the swelling is not a mere change
of solid substance into a fluid, as if by decay, but it is the
result of an active process, which we call <em>suppuration</em>.
When this process is properly performed, good pus is made,
or as the old writers in medicine rather quaintly expressed
it, <em>laudable</em> pus. This process of suppuration, when it is
well done, does not go on here and there in the swelling,
making it like a honeycomb with a multitude of little abscesses;
but there is a consent, an agreement of action by
the vessels of the part, as really as if they worked intelligently.
It is this consent of action which not only makes
the line of movement in the abscess, but points it towards
the surface, instead of giving it some other direction, laterally,
or inward, upon some of the internal organs. But it
is farther to be observed, that in this agreement of action,
the vessels of the part do not all do one thing. Three
different offices are performed by them in the different
quarters of the abcess. While some of these little workmen
are forming the pus, there are others thinning the wall
of the abcess in the direction of the surface, by absorbing
or taking up the substance there; while there are others
still, in the rear, and at the sides of the abcess, depositing
substance, in order to make a barrier to prevent the pus
from being diffused in the surrounding parts. Each class
of these workmen perform their particular work with even
more exactness and harmony than would be expected of
any company of intelligent laborers under the direction of a
leader. The absorbents absorb together, the wall builders
build together, and the makers of pus make pus together,
and deposit it in a common reservoir.</p>

<p>But observe farther, and you will soon see an entire
change come over the whole scene of operations. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
the absorbents have completed their passage for the matter
through the skin, the pus is gradually discharged from its
reservoir, and the “occupation” of the pus makers is soon
“gone.” The wall builders also cease their work, and
while the vacancy becomes filled up by contraction and
deposition, the wall of defense, so carefully maintained, so
long as it was needed, is now taken up by the absorbents—workmen
which seem to know just when, as well as how, to
do their duty, and is emptied into the common circulation,
to be discharged from thence with the general refuse, by
the various outlets of the system.</p>

<p>The object of all this is the restoration of the part to its
healthy condition, and it is effected by a principle existing
in the system—it matters little comparatively by what
name you call it. The name is simply expressive of a
great, general fact, as the term gravitation is, and is not intended,
any more than that term is, as an explanation of
the <em>nature</em> of the fact indicated.</p>

<p>This same principle is in operation in all diseases, resisting
them, hemming them in, and as they retreat, following
hard upon their footsteps, repairing their injuries as well as
it can. It is true that its efforts are often ineffectual, that
they are sometimes overpowered by disease, that they are frequently
perverted by injudicious interference, and that they
are sometimes stimulated to a higher degree than is necessary,
producing over-action, and thus making this conservative
principle an instrument of injury, perhaps destruction. It
would be interesting and profitable to illustrate these several
points in the operation of this principle, but it is not
essential to our purpose.</p>

<p>We will pass now to the consideration of the principle of
self-limitation,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which we find existing in many diseases.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
These diseases have a regular rise and decline, including a set
of processes, and a succession of symptoms peculiar to themselves.
When they have once fairly begun, they cannot be
abridged; neither are they prolonged beyond their natural
limits, though they may, and often do, leave results behind
them, which are sometimes mistaken for a continuance of
the disease itself. The period of continuance is more definite
and fixed in some of these diseases than in others, and
there is a similar difference also in regard to uniformity of
shape. Thus small pox runs through its course with more
regularity of period, and with a more uniform series of
phenomena than scarlet fever, which, though having a
certain general character and average period, is extremely
diversified in its degree of severity, and in its accompanying
circumstances. The more simple and regular and definite
any disease is, the more accurate can our observations
be in regard to it, and the less apt are we to confound
the effects of remedies with the natural changes that take
place in its progress.</p>

<p>This principle of self-limitation is found in the movements
of other diseases of a less definite character than
those which I have mentioned, though it does not manifest
itself so fully, and with so much uniformity. You have already
seen, that in a common inflammatory swelling there is
a regular set of processes going on to its termination, in the
restoration of the part to its healthy condition. The tendency
of the inflammation ordinarily is to finish itself, just
as is the case with any of the definitely shaped diseases, but
its rate of progress cannot be so well calculated upon. The
same can be said of inflammation of any of the organs of
the body, in regard to this tendency to come to a conclusion
of itself; the ways in which it does this varying much,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
according to the texture of the part affected, and other circumstances.</p>

<p>The reader is now prepared to see how it is, that mistakes
may be made, by confounding the effects of remedies
with the changes that arise from the two tendencies,
of which I have been speaking. These mistakes have often
been committed, even in those diseases which are commonly
simple and uniform, and definite in their shape and
course. Take, for example, small pox. It was once the custom
of physicians to give much medicine in this disease,
with the idea that it was controlled and lessened by such a
course, and the system was thus enabled to throw it off more
easily and effectually. But experience has corrected this
error, and the physician now stands by, and sees results
occur in the progress of this malady without the agency of
medicine, which he used once to consider as produced, in
part at least, by the drugs that he administered. Let me
not be understood to say that no medicine at all should be
given in this disease. The office of the physician is to
watch it, and if nature, in going through the processes necessary
to a favorable termination, needs to be assisted by
art, it should be done. But we should be careful not to ascribe
to art what is really effected by nature, for we should
be led by this error to a too officious interference with her
efforts. We may often do much good by medicine—we
may moderate the fever, support the strength when languishing,
bring out the eruption when it recedes, &amp;c. But
to attribute the successful termination of small pox in all
cases to the remedies which have been used, would be as
great an error as it would be to maintain that the poultices,
and other applications made to an inflammatory swelling, are
of course the cause of its suppuration and discharge—or, in
other words, that they cured the inflammation. All that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
can be truly said of them is, that they assisted nature in the
cure. And as these applications may sometimes be of too
stimulating a character to suit the case, and therefore may
increase and extend the inflammation; so the remedies
used in a case of small pox, if they be not actually needed,
may aggravate the disease. And if the patient recover
under such injudicious treatment, it may be supposed that
the medicines cured him, though he actually recovered <em>in
spite of them</em>, because that same blessed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix naturæ</i>
came to the rescue.</p>

<p>If there be so much liability to error in a disease so simple
and uniform as small pox is, it is still greater in those
complaints which are more complicated, from collateral
and accidental influences and affections. Perhaps I cannot
adduce a better example for our purpose than is to be
found in scarlet fever. There is no disease, the history of
whose treatment shows so strikingly the uncertainty of
medical knowledge and experience as this does. The most
opposite and various remedies and modes of treatment
have been lauded as successful, in standard medical works,
and in medical journals, and multitudes of <em>certain</em> cures
have been proclaimed in the newspapers. What is praised
by one is condemned by another; and it is the individual
experience of every rational and candid practitioner, that a
mode of treatment which at one time is attended with
marked success at another is wholly unsuccessful. It cannot
be otherwise in a disease which varies so much as this
does in its degree of severity, in its real character, and in
its attendant circumstances. A respected medical friend,
in reviewing his cases of scarlet fever, found that he had
treated one hundred cases since he had lost a patient with
this complaint. But on the very day on which he made
this review, he was called to a case of scarlet fever which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
ended fatally, and out of thirteen cases in the same neighborhood
he lost seven. With such variations in the severity
of this disease, it is very difficult to avoid erroneous
inferences as to the comparative success of modes of treatment.
This difficulty is increased by the fact, which is
remarkable in this disease, that the degree of severity, or
amount of danger, is by no means always capable of being
measured by the symptoms which present themselves. In
the experience of every physician, who has seen much of
this complaint, many cases have ended fatally, which, up to
within a short period before death, appeared to be doing
better than some others in which recovery took place.
There was much wisdom in the reply that one physician
made to another, who asked him what his mode of treatment
was in scarlet fever. “I have no treatment,” said he.
“I manage each case as an individual case, just as it
strikes me at the time.” And to this conclusion will experience
lead every judicious practitioner.</p>

<p>Let me not be understood to mean that experience,
so valuable in the treatment of all other diseases, is nothing
worth in this complaint—that it establishes no facts,
and no general principles. All that I mean is, that this disease
is so variable in its character and tendencies, that extreme
caution is necessary in applying these principles, and
that the treatment must be at the very antipodes of stereotype—as
variable as the disease itself.</p>

<p>I trust that it is sufficiently obvious to the reader that
great uncertainty must necessarily rest upon our knowledge
of a disease so varied as this is, and that all our experience
of the effects of remedies upon it must be thoroughly sifted,
in order to attain to any measure of accuracy. It is a
disregard of this important truth, that has made the testimony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
of medical men so conflicting in regard to the treatment
of this disease.</p>

<p>I need not spend time to show how the same uncertainty
must embarrass us, to a greater or less degree, in our investigation
of all other diseases. The errors resulting from this
source may be avoided, in part, by observing accurately the
changes which arise from the two tendencies that we have
been considering, their modes, periods, signs, and accompanying
circumstances. The efficacy of this precaution
against error is, as I have already hinted, in proportion to
the simplicity and uniformity of disease. In disorders
which are complicated, and which vary much in their
shape and other circumstances, it is exceedingly difficult to
decide, how much agency, in bringing about the curative
changes, is justly to be referred to the remedies, and how
much to the natural energies of the system. Too much
credit is very commonly given to medicine, and too little
to nature; and sometimes, when some remedy is praised for
its efficacy, and the patient and his friends, and perhaps
even the physician, think that it has saved his life, it had
no agency in promoting his recovery, and perhaps it retarded
it.</p>

<p>I pass now to the consideration of the fourth class of the
causes of the uncertainty of medicine—mental influences.</p>

<p>It never should be forgotten in our observation of disease,
that we have not to deal with the body alone, but with the
body inhabited by a mind, which is connected with every
particle of that body by countless nervous filaments, and
therefore acting through them upon it, and affecting to a
greater or less degree all its diseased conditions.</p>

<p>The influence of causes acting through the mind is often
concealed from our view, and even when it can be plainly
seen it is difficult to estimate its amount with correctness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
Effects are often produced through the mind, which are
attributed by the patient, and sometimes by the physician,
too, to some remedy that has been administered. Take a
very common case. A dyspeptic, who has contracted his
disorder from mental effort, or from the anxieties of business,
applies to his physician. He prescribes some medicine,
and at the same time recommends him to take a
journey, or go to some watering place. He returns cured,
and he perhaps gives the credit for the most part to the
medicine, or to the medicinal waters which he has drank
with scrupulous regularity, either of which may have had
little if anything to do with the cure, and relaxation and
diversion of mind may have been the chief or sole causes
of his recovery. This is a palpable instance of erroneous
inference; but we shall have but a narrow idea of the
influence of mind upon disease, if we confine our view to
cases of so decided a character. Its influence is constant
in all diseases; sometimes plain to be seen, as in the case
just mentioned; often entirely concealed from the most
careful scrutiny; and sometimes revealing itself slightly, so
that the watchful eye of the physician catches mere
glimpses of it, like passing shadows gone in a moment.
Besides the secret griefs and troubles that often hinder recovery,
there are varying states of mind, some of which
the patient may be hardly conscious of himself, that modify
in a thousand ways the movements of disease, and the
action of remedies. For example, the cordial which is
administered is often in part or wholly neutralized by mental
depression, while it is essentially aided in its effects by
the genial and animating influence of hope.</p>

<p>The points to which I have alluded the reader will find
fully illustrated in the chapter on the mutual influence of
mind and body in disease. I will therefore dismiss them for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
the present, and will merely recur again for a moment to
our chemical illustration. If the retort of the chemist, besides
being composed of substances which will act upon its contents,
should have residing in it some secret and subtile
principle, whose existence is known only by its effects, and
which acts both upon the retort itself and on whatever it
contains, the results of his experiments would be rendered
very uncertain. To follow out the analogy—the human
body being the physician’s retort, the mind is just such
a secret and subtile principle, acting in an unseen way both
on the retort and its contents, modifying therefore the
effects of remedial agents, so as to embarrass the physician
in his investigations, and render his conclusions uncertain.</p>

<p>The fifth class of causes of the uncertainty of medical science
remains to be noticed, viz.: individual peculiarities
or <em>idiosyncrasies</em>, as they are termed.</p>

<p>Every individual may, strictly speaking, be said to be
peculiar to some extent, and there is much force in the
popular idea of the benefit resulting from a physician’s being
acquainted with his patient’s constitution. But besides
these common differences, some have very great peculiarities.
A few examples will be sufficient. There are some
persons in whom the odor of roses will produce asthma.
Ipecac has the same effect in some individuals. Some
persons are uniformly made sick by eating strawberries
even in small amount. Cases are constantly met with by
physicians in which some medicines have a peculiar effect.
The various effects produced by opium in different individuals
furnish many examples. I call to mind a patient, who
though a laboring man of considerable power of endurance,
is extremely prostrated by vomiting, by whatever agent it
is produced. I once gave him an emetic without knowing
this peculiarity. He was so much prostrated, that I supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
that the apothecary had made a mistake, and that he
had taken an overdose. But a short time after, I witnessed
in him the same effect induced by undigested food, and this
revealed the idiosyncrasy in his case.</p>

<p>When idiosyncrasies are known, they can be calculated
upon. But they are not always known. We cannot be
aware of them when they respect the action of remedies
which the patient had never taken. And in relation to
remedies which produce no marked and obvious effect, peculiar
susceptibilities may exist without being readily ascertained.
If there be an idiosyncrasy in regard to such a
medicine as an emetic, or an opiate, it is easily discovered.
But if it exist in regard to a remedy that acts silently and
slowly, it may not show itself clearly. The only evidence
that we have of its existence may be the fact, that the
medicine after a while is observed to fail in producing the
effects which we ordinarily expect from it in such cases.
And it may be very doubtful whether this failure is to be
attributed to this cause, or to some other.</p>

<p>Let us recur once more to our illustration from chemistry.
If the retorts used by the chemist, (which, I have
supposed to carry out the analogy, to be composed of materials
which would act upon their contents,) were not all
made exactly alike, but varied a little always in their composition,
and sometimes considerably, and that too without
the variation always being appreciable, this fact would obviously
still further complicate his experiments, and render
them uncertain in their results. So also the peculiarities
in the different human systems, which are the physician’s
retorts into which he introduces his agents, must have the
same effect upon his investigations.</p>

<p>I have now finished the consideration of the various
causes of uncertainty in medical science. If I have succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
at all in making them to be properly appreciated,
the reader will agree with me when I say, that there is no
science that requires higher talents for its successful investigation,
and none that is so liable to wrong influences and
conclusions, if the student of it be a careless and credulous
observer. Notwithstanding this liability, imperatively demanding
caution on the part of the physician, there has
been much of careless observation in this science; and the
recorded experience of the medical profession is therefore
encumbered with a mass of errors. In order to get rid of
these errors, and to establish the proper distinctions between
the certain and the uncertain, between the true and the probable,
while the merely plausible shall be entirely rejected,
a judicious sifting and testing of evidence must be resorted
to, credulity and skepticism both being equally avoided.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> The terms <em>chronic</em> and <em>acute</em> it may be well to define for the benefit
of some of my non-professional readers. An acute disease is one which
runs its course in a short time. A chronic disease, on the other hand, is
one which has a long duration. For example, pneumonia, (commonly
called lung fever,) is an acute disease of the lungs, while consumption is
a chronic disease of the same organ. The term, acute, has reference to
the violence of the symptoms of the diseases to which it is applied, rather
than to their duration; while its opposite term, chronic, has reference to
duration only. Use, however, has given them a technical sense which is

</div>

<p>The uncertainty of medicine is often most unjustly
made to give a free license to blind experimenting. It
should the rather stimulate to the most careful and searching
observation of all the doubtful points of the case in
hand, so that whatever of experimenting may be necessary,
shall be as rational and intelligent as possible. This leads
me to remark, that the views, which we have taken of the
uncertainty of medicine, show us in what real skill in the
practice of the medical art consists. It consists in <em>appreciating
the actual state of the patient in all respects, and then
applying such remedies, and in such quantities and forms
as will do the greatest probable amount of good</em>. This is
apparently a very simple proposition. But if we consider
it in all its bearings, we shall find that more is included in
it than at first sight appears. I will therefore dwell on
some of these points in the order in which they are suggested
to my mind.</p>

<p>Appreciating the true condition of the patient does not
consist merely in finding out the seat, the nature, and the
amount of the disease. This is exceedingly important, it
is true. But it is by no means all of the case. Sometimes
it is but a very partial view of it. For example,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
suppose that the patient has an inflammation of some organ,
and to make the case stronger, let it be a <em>chronic</em> inflammation.
In chronic diseases, as you have seen, there are extensive
results from sympathy and from the action of concurrent
causes in different parts of the system. The physician, in
investigating such a case, in order to proportion his curative
measures with any accuracy to the ends to be accomplished,
must look beyond the main disease, and take into
view the whole case, the state of the different organs, and
the state of the system as a congeries of organs.</p>

<p>A disregard of this important point is very common, and
leads to many errors in practice. Let us look at a few of
them.</p>

<p>Many physicians are disposed to consider the morbid
state of the system in almost every case as arising from
disease in some particular organ. They therefore, in examining
the symptoms, search for this disease; and when
they think that they have found it, they refer to this, either
directly or indirectly, all the phenomena which the case
presents. In their treatment of the case, therefore, they direct
their remedial means principally to the local disease.
They lose sight of the fact, that often there are several organs
simultaneously affected, and that the organ which
seems to be most diseased is sometimes found to be less so
than some other organ, which exhibited no marked signs of
its morbid state. They forget too another important fact—that
the disease of an organ is often a mere result of a general
bad condition of the system. If in such a case the
physician considers the local disease the main thing to be
attacked by remedies, and directs his efforts to that point,
he commits a great error. And this is an error which occurs,
I have no doubt, very often in regard to the most
common of all chronic complaints—consumption. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
local disease is a result, and not a cause, much more often
than is generally supposed, even by physicians.</p>

<p>Some physicians acquire exclusive and narrow notions
of disease, by having their attention particularly directed
to the diseases of certain organs. They get a sort of attachment
to some localities in the system, and are disposed
always to look to their favorite quarters in their search
after the seats of disease. With such an inclination it is
no wonder that they often suppose an organ to be the seat
of fixed disease, which is merely sympathetically affected.</p>

<p>An undue attachment to certain modes of investigation,
to the exclusion of others, is also frequently a source of
error. I mention as an example a too implicit and exclusive
reliance upon what are called the physical signs of
disease. Percussion and auscultation are valuable sources
of evidence, but when they are relied upon to the exclusion
of other sources, as is often the case, they lead to error.
Some who have attained to a high degree of skill in the
use of the stethoscope, have on this account sometimes
adopted very erroneous conclusions, which might have
been avoided by a careful examination of <em>all</em> the sources
of evidence in the case.</p>

<p>Having pointed out some of the errors produced by narrow
and exclusive views in the investigation of the symptoms
of disease, let us now attend to some of the errors
which result from this cause, in the <em>application of remedies</em>.</p>

<p>A remedy may be applicable to a disease which the physician
finds developed in a given case, but there may be
some condition of some organ, which may render it wholly
inapplicable to that case. For example, in a case of inflammation
of the lungs, the state of the stomach may be
such as utterly to forbid the use of some remedies, which
would otherwise be proper. If they be administered in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
spite of this circumstance, they may perhaps produce a
beneficial effect upon the inflammation, and yet may do a
great injury to the patient, perhaps even a fatal one, by
their direct effect upon the diseased stomach. Errors of
this kind do often occur in the practice of those who observe
inaccurately, or who have fallen into a sort of routine
of practice from disinclination to mental effort.</p>

<p>The general condition of the patient sometimes fails to
be appreciated by the practitioner. He may be pursuing
a course which would be admirably adapted to cure the
same disease in a more vigorous patient, and yet in the case
in hand it may be ruinous. Though it may relieve and
even cure the disease, it yet may destroy the patient. The
judicious physician in some cases feels obliged to let morbid
processes go on, because the violence which must necessarily
be done to the debilitated system by the attempt to
arrest them, would put the patient’s life in greater jeopardy,
than it would to let them have their course. Questions
frequently arise on this point, which tax the physician’s
skill and judgment to the utmost. Even when it is proper
to moderate the activity of a diseased process, it is often a
very delicate point to determine just how far this can be
done without doing harm to the patient. Fever is often
moderated by means that irritate the system, or prostrate
its powers to such an extent, that bad results, sometimes
fatal ones, occur; when, if these means had been used less
largely, or perhaps even if they had not been used at all, a
recovery might have taken place.</p>

<p>Sometimes fearful issues depend upon the decision of
the physician. For instance, here is a case which has
been going on for some time without giving much occasion
for anxiety; but all at once it assumes a new aspect. A
new set of formidable symptoms have come on, requiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
an entire change in the treatment. A variety of perplexing
questions now arise in the mind of the physician,—such
as these. If the attempt be made to remove the new symptoms,
how much reason is there to fear that that attempt
will so affect the debilitated patient as to destroy life?
Severe as the symptoms are, is there a probability that, if
a mild course be pursued, the patient may weather the
storm? Will he certainly die if the symptoms are left to
go on without any attempt to arrest them? And if so,
what measures will probably arrest them with the least
amount of risk to the patient’s life? Such are some of
the momentous questions which press upon the physician’s
mind; and, though he would like time to give them a patient
examination, he cannot have it; for there is necessity
for immediate decision and action. The reader can plainly
see, that in order to decide such questions under such circumstances
properly, great comprehensiveness and concentration
of thought, and a cool and clear judgment, are
requisite; and that a mind of narrow views, and loose
habits of observation and reasoning, must often fail to come
to a right decision of them.</p>

<p>Some, in such circumstances, amid all the uncertainty
that beclouds this nice balancing of probabilities, will
doubt and doubt, till the time in which anything effectual
can be done is past by; and the patient dies without having
a single intelligent effort put forth to save him. Others,
in their confusion of ideas, pursue a vacillating course—at
one moment inefficient, at another destructive; and no
rational and steady plan is adopted. Others still, without
waiting to consider the different questions which I have
mentioned, see in the new group of symptoms nothing but
a new enemy to be attacked, and plunge, at once, into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
fight. A reckless course is entered upon, which must
either kill or cure.</p>

<p>The truly judicious physician, in contrast with all these,
is neither bewildered nor precipitate. He takes a rapid
view of all the circumstances of the case, and looks carefully
at the important and perplexing questions which start
up one after another in his mind, and then decides intelligently,
coolly, and definitely upon his plan of treatment.
He may err, it is true; but if he does, it is not his fault,
for he has made use of all possible precautions to prevent
error. The plan which he fixes upon, he does not pursue
obstinately, as being, without a doubt, the best. While it
is that which he believes to be the best at the time, he
watches its progress, and if he see reason afterward to
alter it, he does so. Aware of the uncertainty of his knowledge,
while he decides at every step what it is best to do,
he is ready to reverse that decision, and change his course,
whenever any new development in the case shall call
for it.</p>

<p>Sometimes he decides that it is best to wait and watch
the movements of the case. Many seem to demand that
he shall pursue an active course of treatment all the time,
to conquer the disease—that he shall be keeping up a constant
cannonade upon it from beginning to end, not reflecting
that if he do so, many of his shots must be worse than
lost. And some physicians yield to this demand, and pursue
this destructive course. The public call them bold
practitioners; and they do gain some apparently splendid
victories over disease; but if the results of their whole
campaign (to carry out the illustration) could be fairly
estimated, they would be found not to deserve the reputation
for success, which is accorded to them. The prudent
and judicious physician, like the prudent and judicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
general, fires as few random shots as possible, taking
good care, too, that he hit none but enemies—husbands
carefully all his resources—rests from his battle with disease
whenever it is best to do so, maintaining, for the time,
a “masterly inactivity”—retreats when he finds his line of
movement is likely to prove disastrous—calculates probabilities
as accurately as he can at every step, and endeavors
to make every measure tell upon the great result,
avoiding, as far as possible, those which will not, and
especially those which will hinder or defeat it.</p>

<p>Sometimes the physician finds that he must be satisfied
for the present with but a partial view of the case before
him. He sees that there are some agencies at work, which
are hidden from his view. Under such circumstances, while
the careless and adventurous practitioner makes up his
theory of the case confidently, and acts upon it, supplying
what is not known from his own imagination, and
mingling all together in one confused mass; the judicious
physician, on the other hand, cautiously distinguishes between
what he actually knows and what may be supposed,
acts upon this knowledge, and watches for farther developments
to clear up what is doubtful. He treats the case
according to the indications of the presenting symptoms,
carefully scrutinizing the effects of his remedies. Perhaps
he succeeds in cutting off at first some of the tributaries
of the disease; and, by so doing, patiently and perseveringly,
he at length comes at the main disease—the starting
point of the whole case.</p>

<p>In pointing out the characteristics of medical skill,
allusion was made to the quantities and forms in which
remedies are administered. These must, of course, be
varied to suit each individual case. Sometimes a very
nice adaptation is necessary, especially in regard to quantity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
A remedy, which is appropriate to a case, may be
given in such a quantity as to be injurious. The use of a
medicine may be continued too long. It may have accomplished
all the good that it can; and the continuance of it
will do harm, perhaps even beyond the undoing of all the
good which it has effected. Sometimes a change occurs
in the condition of the patient of such a character, that a
remedy, which has been up to that time beneficial in its influence,
will now produce bad results. Medicine is often
continued under such circumstances. Such are some of the
errors to which the physician is liable in regard to the
quantity of medicine to be given, if he be at all loose in
his habits of observation.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no one thing in medical practice in
which failure is so common, as in the accurate proportioning
of remedies to the condition of each case. A physician
may discover very clearly the nature of the malady,
and decide with great correctness upon the appropriate
medicines, and yet, may err after all in applying these
medicines in the proper amounts, and at the proper intervals.
The variations, in these respects, required by different
cases, have a wide range—some demanding large doses
to produce the needed effects, and others being strongly
affected by small ones. In some cases of severe pain, for
example, very large doses of opium in some of its forms
are necessary to give relief; while, in other cases, in which,
perhaps, the pain is by no means slight, quite small doses
accomplish the purpose. Similar variations in the quantities
of remedies, are required by other circumstances,
which are less obvious in their indications on this point,
than so palpable a symptom as pain is. The contingencies
on which these variations depend, are often, indeed,
so uncertain and so secret, that they elude the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
watchful and patient investigation, much more that which
is hasty and careless.</p>

<p>Experience gives to the shrewd and judicious physician
a sort of tact in detecting these contingencies, and in so
modifying his practice as to meet with some good degree
of fitness the various indications which they present. This
tact is to be acquired at the bedside of the sick, by patient
watching of the workings of disease, and of the influence
of remedies upon it; and though the experience of others
is a valuable auxiliary in acquiring it, it is only an auxiliary,
and cannot communicate it alone. There are a thousand
little things that are observed in watching disease
from day to day, which materially influence the physician
in the details of his treatment, but which it is impossible
to record in the history of the case. It is therefore peculiarly
true of the wise and skillful physician, that when he
dies much wisdom will die with him. And the student of
medicine always finds, when he comes to actual practice,
that disease, in the sick chamber, is a very different thing
from what he supposed it to be when listening to descriptions
of it in the lecture-room. One of the first lessons
that he learns is, that the long troup of maladies, arranged
in the syllabus of the professor, gives but a faint idea of
the various and Protean shapes of disease, as they appear
before him, in all their complications, with mingled and
confused lineaments, instead of the distinct ones with which
they are necessarily described in books and lectures. He
sees that the general principles which he has learned, are
to be applied with almost endless variations; and that a
searching and ever-vigilant observation is needed to apply
them aright.</p>

<p>The points which I have endeavored to elucidate, in regard
to skill in the management of disease, are very commonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
disregarded by the community, and too often even
by physicians. To impress them more vividly upon the
mind of the reader, I will resort to an illustration, in which
some of the same principles are applied to quite a different
matter.</p>

<p>Two travellers are wending their way through a mountain-pass
to their home. Their path is a perilous one;
now lying along on the very brink of a precipice, and now
across a succession of points of rock, with an abyss yawning
below. Often the foothold of the traveller is but a
slight one, and would scarcely suffice were there not some
shrub near by that could be caught hold of, or some projecting
point of rock on which he could hook his fingers.
One of the travellers is weary and sick, and the other is
helping him along. The shades of evening have come on,
and the flying clouds occasionally obscure the light of the
moon that shines upon their path.</p>

<p>It needs a watchful eye, a strong arm, and a firm foot, to
go through this pass with safety, even by broad daylight.
How fearful, then, are the dangers that threaten the sick
traveller? If he were alone, he could not possibly get to the
journey’s end. He would fail to reach some foothold, or
would let go his grasp upon some shrub, or totter from
some giddy height, and be dashed to pieces. His companion
sees the difficulties of the task before him, and bidding
the poor sick man to be of good cheer, nerves himself
for labors that will tax all his strength and all his
skill.</p>

<p>See how varied is the assistance which he renders!
Now he is before, with outstretched hand raising him up;
and now behind, doing the same office, while the feeble
man clings to some branch, or to some projecting point of
rock. Now you see him gently supporting his tottering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
steps, as he leads him slowly along a narrow path on the
edge of a precipice, where, if he but stumble, he is lost.
The effort is now but a slight one; but it requires caution,
firmness, and skill. And now there is needed a strong,
almost an Herculean effort. He must raise him to the top
of a rock just large enough to stand upon, and there let
him rest a moment, so that he may step carefully to another
rock which offers a secure resting-place. He pauses
before making the effort, to calculate with precision the
amount of force needed. He sees that if he come short of
raising him to the right spot even an inch, his feet may
slip, and he is gone. And on the other hand, if he use too
much force, he may throw him too far, and then he will
plunge over beyond. His courage almost fails him, as he
sees the fearful issues—the issues of life and death, that
hang on that one effort. But it must be made. Uttering
the cheerful words of hope in his companion’s ear, with his
whole frame roused to its utmost tension, he makes the
attempt. The poor man’s feet just reach a jutting edge
of the rock, while he catches with his fingers upon another
projection, and there he hangs. His strength is almost exhausted;
but he knows that if he lets go he is lost. His
friend presses his feet fast to the rock, and tells him to hold
on. Then finding some foothold by which he can raise
himself a little higher, he lifts his sick companion gently to
the summit. There he remains a few moments, trembling,
and almost poised upon a point, fearing to move, or even
to look down from that giddy height, lest he should slip off.
But soon, with the little rest that he gets in this perilous
situation, and encouraged by the firm and cheerful voice
of his friend, he steps to the next rock, where a broad and
sure foothold enables him to pause and recover his little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
strength, which was well-nigh exhausted by his anxiety
and his exertions.</p>

<p>The path is now an easy one for some distance, but soon
they are confronted by a high crag, up which they must
clamber. It looks gloomy and formidable in the dim and
fitful light of the partially-obscured moon. The sick man’s
heart almost dies within him, as his companion eyes narrowly
the small footholds which are notched up its steep
side. Some of them he sees but faintly; but soon the
full light of the moon, through the breaking clouds, shows
him every notch with distinctness. He calculates their
distances in a moment, and as his eye runs upward to the
top, he plans out the whole of his ascent. In an instant
he seizes his friend; and, again bidding him be of
good cheer, tells him to place his foot in the first notch,
then raises him gently, but firmly, to the second, and so on
to the summit.</p>

<p>It is thus that the sick man, aided and cheered by his
friend, after going through with many narrow escapes, at
length reaches his home.</p>

<p>The points of resemblance between this journey and
the journey of sickness, are sufficiently obvious to suggest
themselves at once to the minds of my readers. The
journey of sickness has sometimes the same variety of
peril, and demands of the physician the same variety of
assistance, to suit its various stages and conditions. His
efforts, in rendering this assistance, must sometimes be
strong and sometimes gentle; sometimes bold and sometimes
cautious; always careful and never precipitate. The uncertain
and varying light, shining upon the path of the
traveller, has its counterpart in the journey of sickness;
and sometimes the darkness is so great, that the physician
must stop short, and not move at a venture amid such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
perils. There are times, too, when the light breaks
through the clouds of uncertainty that hang over his path,
and his eye must be open and ready, as was the traveller’s,
to discern all that the light may reveal of that which lies
before him.</p>

<p>Often, in most of the journey of sickness, a gentle, but
firm support and guidance are needed, on the part of the
physician, just as it was in the case of the traveller, when
the path lay along the edge of a precipice; and here, in the
one journey as well as in the other, an officious and hurrying
assistance might prove ruinous. Then there are times
(and fearful times they are) when the physician sees, as
did the sick man’s companion, that while mighty efforts are
required of him, even a slight error in regard to the right
proportion in those efforts, may prove fatal. And, as the
traveller found occasionally some broad and sure resting-place,
where his friend could recruit his wasted energies
after a severe effort; so in the journey of sickness there
are such resting-places, and the physician must take care
to give his patient the benefit of them, and not run the risk
of an entire exhaustion of his powers, from too much
anxiety to hasten to the journey’s end.</p>

<p>One more point of resemblance, and one which I deem
of no small importance, I will barely notice. As the sick
man, in all the way through the mountain-pass, was encouraged
by his friend, so should the physician cheer his
patient with his hopeful voice and manner, amid all the
gloom and peril of the journey of sickness; and should
hold out to him, in all seasons of despondency, so far as
truth will allow him to do so, the hope that he will at length
reach the end of that journey in safety.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br>
<span class="fs80">POPULAR ERRORS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>My intention in this chapter is to notice some of the
popular errors, which have resulted from the uncertainty of
medicine.</p>

<p>One of the most common of these errors is a false estimate
of the importance of <em>positive</em> medication. This error
appears in a great variety of forms. I will notice a few of
them.</p>

<p>A patient once avowed to me the opinion, that in all cases
of recovery from sickness, the recovery is to be attributed
to medicine, and that nature never cured anybody of anything
that could properly be called disease. Though this
error is seldom carried to such a point of ultraism as this,
it does exist, to a great extent, even in the medical profession,
and it is exceedingly prevalent in the community at
large. It therefore exerts a great influence upon the popular
modes of the treatment of disease.</p>

<p>One of the most common examples of this false reference
of a curative result to the agency of medicine, is to be seen
in the prevalent popular notion in regard to the healing of
wounds. The cure in this case, is usually attributed to
some healing property in the applications made to the
wounds. But the truth is, that the union of the divided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
parts is effected entirely by a natural process; and the only
use of any applications, is to put the lips of the wound in
apposition, so that this process may be effectual in securing
this union. The popular error on this subject, is not as
prevalent now, as it once was, and the array of salves and
ointments for the healing of wounds, is fast passing away.
At a time when this error was in full favor with the people,
some one broached the idea, that the medicaments ought
to be applied to the instrument that inflicted the wound,
instead of being applied to the wound itself. This new
mode of practice proved successful in comparison with the
old, for the plain reason, that the wounds thus treated were
not subjected to applications, which would irritate them,
and thus interfere with nature’s process of healing. It acquired
a great reputation all over England, and I believe,
in other countries also; and the results of the practice were
triumphantly referred to as proofs of its success, that were
not to be gainsayed. It is related that in one case, in which
the wound became very painful, it was suggested that something
might have happened to the axe with which the wound
was made, and which had therefore been duly anointed with
a healing salve; and as the axe happened to be at some
distance, a messenger was sent in great haste, who found
that it had fallen down from its place, and the dressings
were consequently deranged. Here was certainly the
cause of all the pain, and accordingly it was ascertained,
that at the very time that the messenger re-applied the salve
to the axe, and set it up in its place, the patient became
perfectly easy!<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>As another very common example of an undue disposition
to refer results in the course of disease to positive medication,
I would mention the fact, that those who have the
care of the sick, often attribute any change that may occur,
whether it be favorable or unfavorable, almost as a matter
of course, to the remedy that was administered immediately
before the change took place. They do this sometimes
when the medicine has not had time to produce any effect
at all. They do not reflect that some remedies act much
more slowly than others, nor that changes are often induced
by other agencies than the action of medicine. This error
is met with every day, and the cunning and dishonorable
physician makes capital out of it whenever he can. A
physician of this character was once called to a case of
quinsy, in which the abscess in the throat was just ready
to break. Perceiving that here was a fair chance for
making the “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post hoc, propter hoc</i>” mode of reasoning subserve
his purpose, he assured the suffering patient that he
had some powders, which were “sure to break the quinsy.”
While he was preparing some of them in an adjoining
room, the nurse came out and told him that they should not
need his powders, for the quinsy had broken. The wily
doctor could not help remarking in an undertone to a student,
whom he was indoctrinating in the <em>arts</em>, as well as in
the science of medicine, “I wish that I had been lucky
enough to have got down one of my powders before that
quinsy broke.”</p>

<p>When one recovers from sickness, it is very common for
his neighbors and friends to inquire, what it was that cured
him—as if there was some one remedy that effected the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
cure. It is true, that in some cases, the agency of some
one medicine is so prominent, that it may very properly be
said to have been the cause of the recovery. But this
does not often happen. In the great majority of cases, the
cure is to be attributed to the whole course of treatment,
including many different remedies and measures.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And
very often the negative portions of the course are of as
much importance as the positive remedies that have been
given, perhaps even more so. Thus, in some cases of inflammation
of the eye, the exclusion of light is as necessary
to the cure as the leeching, the blistering, &amp;c. So also in
inflammation of the brain, the exclusion of noise and excitement
from the room of the patient, is as essential as
any of the positive medication which may be employed.</p>

<p>The undue reliance which is placed upon positive medication
is also seen in the disposition, which is so very
common, to demand of the physician, that he shall be doing
something all the time to overcome the disease. They who
make this demand, do not reflect, that in the warfare with
disease, as well as in every other warfare, there are times
to do, and <em>times also to rest from doing</em>. In some cases,
indeed, there are periods when it would be certain death to
the patient to employ any positive agencies of any amount,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
of power. It was the remark of a shrewd old physician,
who was often found fault with for giving so little medicine,
that it takes as much knowledge to know <em>what not to
do</em>, as it does to know what to do? This is an important
truth; and I have not a doubt that, in the practice of every
physician, who is disposed to give much medicine, sickness
often results in death in really curable cases, simply because
he did not know what <em>not</em> to do, and therefore did what he
ought to have left undone. And yet those who drug their
patients freely, are more apt to satisfy the mass of the
community, than those who place less reliance upon positive
medication. The friends of persons who have died,
often remark, as a matter of consolation, that they are sure
enough was done, that no means of relief that was suggested
was left untried, &amp;c., not seeming to dream that it
was possible that too much was done. It appears sometimes
to be the idea of the friends of the sick, that one
remedy after another must be tried, in order to overcome
the disease, until the effectual one is found; and that all the
remedies which fail in this trial, simply fail, and do no
positive harm. Accordingly, when any grave case occurs,
they are disposed to call in many physicians, one after
another, with the idea that “one may think of something
that another did not.” And they are satisfied with no one
who is thus called in, unless he recommend to the attending
physician some medicine or measure, that has not yet
been tried in the case. If he recommend the lessening of
some medicine in quantity, or the discontinuance of it, this
does not satisfy such persons, though the change may be
of so great importance, that it may be justly considered as
an entirely new course of treatment—as really new as it
would be, if a new set of remedies were adopted.</p>

<p>It is a very common idea, that medicines have a sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
natural relation to disease. This idea appears in different
forms. Some talk about disease as if it were a palpable
thing, which is to be attacked, to be hit, to be driven out,
or drawn out from its hiding place; and they suppose that
there are certain remedies which are calculated to effect
these different objects. They therefore speak of the drawing
off of “bad matter,” by a blister, and of the “bad blood,”
which is taken from one by bleeding, as if the disease itself
in palpable shape, was abstracted in these ways from
the system.</p>

<p>The most common of these palpable shapes which disease
is supposed to assume, is that of “humors,” as they are
termed in popular language. The disappearance of a
“humor” is the <em>effect</em> quite as often as it is the cause of disease;
and yet it is very difficult to make people understand
this—they persist in thinking it always to be a cause. So
also, if a patient, on recovering from any sickness, has
some eruption appear upon the skin, it is taken for granted,
that it was this “humor” that has been inside all the time,
which has caused all the sickness; and now that it has
ceased to play its pranks among the internal organs, and
has come out, the patient as a consequence gets well. It
never enters their minds, that the eruption may be simply
a result of that revival of the energies of the system, which
is consequent upon its escape from the depressing influence
of disease.</p>

<p>This idea of the palpable shape of disease gives rise to
the popular error, which is so prevalent, in regard to the
necessity of getting out <em>all</em> the eruption in such diseases,
as scarlet fever, measles, &amp;c. The idea is that there is a
certain amount in the system, and that this must <em>all</em> be
brought out upon the skin, or the patient will suffer some
bad consequences from this retention of morbid matter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
This notion is entirely erroneous. The eruption in such
cases is not the coming out or throwing off of diseased
matter contained in the system, but it is merely one of a
succession of processes in the natural course of the disease.
It is indeed necessary that this process should be well executed,
and if the natural energies of the system do not
prove adequate, they should be assisted by medicine. But
ordinarily they are adequate; and in comparatively very
few cases, is there any need of any assistance from art in
bringing out the eruption. Most of the dosing so common
in scarlet fever and in measles, for this purpose, is worse
than useless—it aggravates the symptoms, multiplying and
inflaming the eruption beyond the necessities of the case,
and it increases the complications which are incidental to
it. Death is often the consequence of such officious interference
with nature’s regular processes.</p>

<p>Some talk about disease as if it were a poison, whose
power can be destroyed by the appropriate agents, very
much as an alkali neutralizes an acid. All medicines which
do not have this neutralizing influence are, in their view,
mere palliatives. It is this idea which lies at the foundation
of the opinion, so often expressed, that opium never
cures any real disease, but merely gives temporary relief.
No opinion can be more erroneous than this. Opium, in
its various forms, is one of our chief means of <em>curing</em> disease,
as well as of alleviating its sufferings. It is an effectual
remedy for many painful affections. For example, it
is the great remedy for spasmodic colic. There are auxiliary
remedies, which can be used with profit, it is true;
but after all opium is the chief remedy. And in the great
majority of cases of disease, with which the physician
meets in his daily practice, opium materially assists in its
cure, by soothing and quieting the irritation of the system,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
so that the curative power of nature (the vis medicatrix
naturæ, of which so much was said in my first chapter),
may pursue undisturbed and without hindrance, her processes
of restoration.</p>

<p>Another error, to which this idea of the neutralizing influence
of medicines gives rise, is this. What is found to
be useful in any disease is supposed to be so in all cases of
that disease. If a remedy be “good” for a certain malady,
fever for example, it is apt to be considered as being “good”
in all cases of fever, without regard to circumstances.
There is a great proneness to suppose all cases of one disease
to be alike, and to require therefore similar remedies.
The physician finds it difficult often to make people understand
that two cases, in which the disease bears the same
name, may require very different, and perhaps almost opposite
modes of treatment. The accompanying circumstances
of disease vary so much in different cases, that
this supposed invariable relation of particular remedies to
the cure of particular diseases is impossible. This remark
applies even to our most efficient remedies. Colchicum is
one of the most effectual remedies which we have for
rheumatism; and yet there are many cases of this disease,
in which its use is forbidden by the condition of the
patient.</p>

<p>The idea, that medicines have a kind of natural relation
to disease, assumes sometimes a more definite shape than
either of those to which I have alluded. Some suppose that
almost all, if not all, diseases have their specific remedies
and antidotes. It is often said by those who have this idea,
that there are medicines in the plants that grow in any
country, which can cure every disease that prevails in that
country, if they could only be found. Indians and “Indian
doctors” are supposed to know of many of these specifics.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
The newspapers announce too occasionally the discovery
of specifics for the most formidable of diseases, consumption,
cancers, hydrophobia, locked jaw, &amp;c., &amp;c. These
announcements are accompanied sometimes with statements
of cures of the most positive character. No doubt the
statements are correct in one respect—the patients recovered.
So were the wounds healed when the ointments were
applied to the instruments that made them. In some way
these specifics after a while lose their reputation. There is
a constant succession of them, all equally infallible for the
time, but the period of their infallibility is short. Their
reputation is built upon the “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post hoc, propter hoc</i>” mode of
reasoning, and therefore does not stand the test of any continued
experience.</p>

<p>In order that this subject may be fairly understood by my
readers, they should know what we mean by a specific remedy.
A specific remedy for a disease is one which will
cure that disease under all ordinary circumstances—that
is, when there are no circumstances in the case, apart from
the disease, which tend to prevent the cure. Many doubt
the existence of any specifics at all. If there be any, they
are certainly very few in number. Sulphur and some mercurial
preparations, as remedies for Psora (itch), and some
other cutaneous diseases, have as strong a claim to be considered
specifics as any medicines that can be mentioned.
Iodine has been said to be a specific for scrofula, but it by
no means holds good its claim. Though tuberculous consumption
is a disease of a very definite and specific form, no
specific remedy has been as yet discovered for it, and probably
none will ever be, though Dr. Rush and others have
indulged the pleasing hope that some plant may yet be found
that will arrest the ravages of this disease. I would remark
in this connection, that there is one specific preventive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
I refer to vaccination as a preventive of small-pox.
But this fact stands entirely <em>alone</em>—there is no other fact
like it.</p>

<p>The physician is continually meeting with evidence, that
the community generally have no adequate ideas of the
necessity for discrimination in medical practice. He is
every day called to patients, who tell him that they have
taken some patent pills, or perhaps some pills which they
chanced to have in the house, and which they supposed
must be “good,” as they express it, though they may not
know where they came from, or what they are commonly
used for; and this is done by many, without regard to the
kind of malady under which they are suffering. All cases
must first be dosed by pills, to which they attach this general
idea of being “good;” and then, if they do not hit the
disease with this random shot, they send for the doctor, not
however with the belief, that his shooting will be any less
at a venture, but because he may have a greater variety of
ammunition.</p>

<p>One of the strongest evidences that the community have
a very imperfect conception of the varieties of disease, and
of the necessity of accurate discrimination, is the propensity
to look for some one grand remedy for all diseases.
This propensity is exceedingly common, and exists in
every variety of degree. Some, I may say many, have the
full belief that there is such a remedy, and try every
vaunted medicine that comes along, in their search after
the great catholicon, or elixir vitæ. Disease they suppose,
in the language of quacks, and we may add of some physicians
also, to be an unit, and the remedy for it must therefore
be an unit also. Others, (and these form a large portion
of the community,) while their ideas are less distinct
and exclusive, are still governed in a great measure by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
this same prevailing notion. They have some favorite
remedy, which they use for complaints of almost every kind.
The remedy may not always be the same, and commonly is
not. The ‘universal cure’ does not ordinarily last a great
while, but is at length supplanted by some other, just as
universal, which in its turn, is also to be supplanted. Every
year, not to say every month, brings to some people a new
grand catholicon.</p>

<p>This propensity does not always show itself in relation to
some one remedy, but sometimes leads to the adoption of
some system or class of remedies. I mention as an example
the Thompsonian system. A certain group of remedies
was selected by the founder of this system, from the whole
kingdom of nature, as the remedies above all others, if not
alone, fitted to attack the great unit, disease. The very
idea of discrimination was discarded. The unit was to be
attacked with these weapons, and the attack kept up till it
was destroyed. No fear was indulged that any harm could
be done, for Thompson claimed that his remedies had a
natural relation to disease, possessed by no other agents,
and that therefore, however largely they might be taken,
they could not possibly do any injury. How beautifully
simple this system of practice is; and, if its claims be just,
what a perfect relief it brings to all the uncertainty of
medicine! Away then with all care-worn experience, and
all study! Keep up a constant fire of lobelia, red pepper,
and steam, and you will certainly kill the disease at last—at
least if you do not kill the patient. In the infancy of this
system, this idea of its simplicity was more distinctly avowed
than it is now, and the remedies that were used were
much less in number than they now are. The followers
of Thompson are certainly departing from the stern principles
of his doctrine, and some of them even begin to talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
about the necessity of study—a heresy, one would think,
glaring enough almost to start Samuel Thompson from his
grave!</p>

<p>It is most impudently asserted by Thompsonians, that
physicians generally act upon the same exclusive principles
that they themselves do—that while Thompsonians give
lobelia and cayenne in all cases, we do the same in regard
to calomel, antimony, &amp;c. This is undoubtedly true of
some physicians, but it is a gross slander when it is applied
to the profession in the mass. The real difference in this
matter between Thompsonians and physicians is this.
While Thompsonians confine themselves to one particular
set of remedies for all diseases, physicians use in their daily
practice a great variety of remedies, and among them the
very medicines used by Thompsonians. We have never
claimed, as Thompsonians falsely state that we do, that
lobelia and cayenne are not good medicines, but simply
that they are not applicable to all cases, any more than is
calomel, or any other remedy that may be named.</p>

<p>The quack shows in his advertisements, that he is aware
of the prevalence of the propensity of which I have spoken,
and here rests his chief hope of success. He begins his
advertisement with something of this kind. Disease is an
unit; or, All disease is in the blood; therefore the blood
must be purified; or, Grand catholicon; or, Grand antidote
to disease; or, The real essence of life at last discovered.</p>

<p>This propensity has shown itself in some measure even
among physicians. Enthusiasts in our profession have
always been disposed to attribute to favorite remedies, a
sort of universality in their operation upon disease. Every
new medicine that comes up to notice has almost every
kind of virtue ascribed to it by such physicians. And it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
is only by long-continued and well-weighed experience, that
the statements made in relation to any remedy can be
sifted, and the real truth be discovered in regard to the
degree and extent of its efficacy, and the circumstances
which should govern us in its use. This process has been
gone through with, in the case of every article of the
materia medica that has ever had any notoriety. Take for
example, digitalis. At one time, this medicine was in common
use in many diseases, and especially in consumption;
and some enthusiasts, if they did not go so far as to say
that it was a certain cure when used sufficiently early, at
least extolled it as almost a specific for this disease. The
accumulated and compared experience of physicians in regard
to it has at length determined pretty nearly its value,
and while it is now used far less than it once was, it is used
more judiciously from the more definite knowledge of its
effects which this experience has gained for us.</p>

<p>The same remarks could be made about other articles.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
And while the test of experience has corrected our valuation
of some remedies, and thus enabled us to use them
with more skill; there are others once supposed to be
valuable, which, under the application of this test, have
gone wholly out of use. I will mention but a single example.
Dr. Beddoes, an English physician of some note,
but a great enthusiast, thought that some of the gases
might be advantageously used in the treatment of disease.
The results were said to be astonishing, and the practice of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
pneumatic medicine, as it was called, became very prevalent.
I find in a work, called Medical Extracts, published
in 1799, the narrative of sixty-nine cases of various diseases,
said to be cured by the respiring of these gases.
Among them are certainly some formidable maladies, such
as dropsy in the head and chest, consumption, gout, epilepsy,
leprosy, scrofula, &amp;c. Some of these cases had been
previously under the care of celebrated physicians, and
some had even been pronounced by them to be incurable.
A description given by one of the patients, a clergyman,
of his own case, almost transcends the descriptions given
now-a-days by some clergymen of the effects of some
patent medicine, or of the infinitesimal doses of homœopathy.</p>

<p>Now, if the respiring of these gases really did produce
these results, or any good proportion of them, the same
practice would have been in vogue now. But it has not
stood the test of experience, and therefore has been rejected.
No physician at the present day thinks of setting his patients
to breathing these gases.</p>

<p>If it be said that this is the result of change of fashion
merely, and that it therefore does not prove that this practice
was not successful, I reply that, though fashion in medicine
may sometimes temporarily prevent the use of a
good remedy, it never effects the entire and continued
abandonment of it by medical men. You will find it
always true of remedies and modes of practice which are
really valuable, that though they may not be as fashionable
after a while, as they were when first introduced into notice,
and may, from the fact, that they have been estimated
too highly, be for a time undervalued, they will never be
wholly given up by the profession. Nearly as great stories
were told about calomel and digitalis at first, as were told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
about the gases of Dr. Beddoes. But while experience
has shown that calomel and digitalis were over estimated,
it has proved that these gases had an entirely false estimate
put upon their remedial powers.</p>

<p>It is thus that the medical profession, corrects by experience
the errors into which it is led by the uncertainty of
medical science. But the community at large pursue a
very different course. They never correct their errors,
but only supplant one error by introducing another.
While physicians reject what is found by experience to be
valueless, and retain what is truly valuable, the multitude
reject alike the good and the bad, in making their constant
changes from remedy to remedy, and from system to system.
It is mere caprice, and not a careful discrimination, that
leads them to throw aside one favorite medicine or system,
and adopt another.</p>

<p>It is amusing to watch the movements of the community
in relation to quack medicines. Of these there are a multitude
constantly appealing to the credulity of the public.
Some of them in some way, acquire a currency above their
fellows, and from the extent to which they are used, and
from the tales of their wonder-working from all quarters of
the land, and from all conditions of life, one would suppose
that these remedies would never go out of use until mankind
cease to be sick. But look again, only a few years
after, and these vaunted medicines have gone out of use,
and the flaming advertisements proclaiming their virtues
have disappeared, and other remedies have taken their
places in the public mind, and on the public tongue, and of
course in the public stomach. This process of change in
the prominent remedies before the public, has ever been
going on. Take a single example. A few years ago, almost
every invalid was swallowing the Hygeian pills, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
the pauper that purchased them with his begged pittance,
up to lords and ladies, and senators, and generals, and clergymen.
But in a short time, Brandreth’s effulgent glory burst
upon the earth, and the Hygeian orb faded, and glimmered,
and sunk to rise no more. And now Brandreth is rapidly
on the decline, giving way to others who are rising to take
his place.</p>

<p>These successive changes in popular remedies show, that
the public have always been egregiously mistaken, whenever
they have attributed to them such wonderful efficacy. Else
the very high and extensive reputation gained by each could
not have been so utterly lost in so short a time. If, for instance,
a tithe of the fame of the Hygeian pills was well
founded, the thousands of mouths that swallowed them would
not have been, as they were almost in a twelvemonth, just
as wide open to receive the magic pills of Brandreth.
Either a large portion of the community have committed
a great error, in ascribing such marvellous efficacy to these
remedies; or they have committed a greater one in so soon
discarding them. Either the one or the other of these errors
has been committed, in regard to each one of the most
popular remedies, that have succeeded each other in the
favor of the public, from time immemorial—not one that
has not had its <em>decline</em>, as well as its <em>rise</em>, and its <em>acme</em>.
And what is remarkable is, that when once a remedy has
thoroughly passed from the popular favor, no matter how
great its fame has been, it never can be revived again, unless
it be under an entirely new name, and with new pretensions.
Why? Because it has been tried, and its reputation
was found to be a splendid bubble that has burst
and fallen. And the public, like the child, when a bubble
has burst, has done with that one forever, and busies itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
at once in raising another, which, in its turn, is succeeded
by another, and so on to the end, if end there be, which
seems to be hardly a possibility with the bubbles of
quackery.</p>

Though the newspapers are filled with new and <em>certain</em> cures, no

in this country. Physicians do however know better how to treat it, than
they did then; but it is only because experience has taught them better

<span class="fs80">QUACKERY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The reader is now prepared, by the facts and considerations
presented in the previous chapters, to see in what
way quackery, in its various forms, has obtained such a
hold upon the community. If results in medical treatment
could always be traced to their real cause, there would be
no room for the arts of the empiric. But the reader has
seen that, in the progress of every case of disease, there
are many causes acting together in the development of results,
and that many of these act secretly; and that there is,
therefore, special need of caution in our conclusions, in
regard to the operation of remedies. And yet, notwithstanding
the manifest necessity for caution, there is no subject
to which the ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post hoc propter hoc</i>’ mode of reasoning
is so frequently, and so incautiously applied. It is the
erroneous reference of effects to causes, consequent upon
this mode of reasoning, which is the great source of
quackery.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>Let us see how this result is produced.</p>

<p>Take any remedy, no matter what it is, whether it be
positive in its character, or entirely inert, and it can be
made to acquire an extensive reputation for curing disease.
Suppose that it is of a positive character. Let
quite a large number of persons in a community be persuaded
to take it. It would be appropriate to a few out of
the whole number of cases, just as a man firing into a
crowd of men at random would be apt to hit some of
them. Then there are some, who, through the recovering
power of nature, get well while using the medicine, perhaps
even in spite of it, and falsely attribute the cure to it.
The <em>many</em> that are not benefitted soon, give up the use of
the remedy, and the fact that they have taken it is known
to but few, and is soon forgotten even by them. But the
few that <em>chance</em> to derive benefit from it, or that are cured
by nature while taking it, proclaim everywhere the virtues
of the remedy with the ardent gratitude of restored health,
and willingly give certificates of their cure for the benefit
of suffering humanity. All this helps to get the new
remedy in vogue in other places; and wherever it is introduced,
the same result, for the most part, is realized. The
consequence is, that the remedy comes into extensive use,
and continues in the popular favor, till some other remedy,
by the same process, supplants it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>Even if the remedy be not of a positive character, but
wholly inert, enough of the whole number that take it will
get better, from the curative power of nature, and from
mental influence, to give it, for a time, the reputation of
curing disease. Many examples might be given. An
amusing instance of the celebrity sometimes gained by
inert remedies, occurred in Paris. A man who had sold
to great profit an eye-water, at length died without communicating
to any one the composition of it. His widow
regretted the loss of the profits which came from the sale
of the eye-water. Without telling her trouble to any one,
she filled up the phials from the River Seine, and went on
to sell the eye-water as usual. Cures occurred as before,
and everybody believed that her husband had bequeathed
the recipe to her. On her death-bed her conscience was
much disturbed on account of the deception which she
had thus practised upon the community, and she made
confession to the physician who attended upon her. He,
however, quieted her mind by telling her, that he was
sure she need give herself no uneasiness, for her medicine
had at least done no harm—a consolation which most venders
of secret medicines could not have.</p>

<p>The variety of both active and inert remedies, which
have enjoyed, in the way that I have indicated, a temporary
popularity, is very great. Even calomel, which now
seems to be especially despised by all empirics and their
followers, has had its hey-day of popular favor. It was
one of the chief remedies of Paracelsus, who has been
styled the prince of quacks. And some years ago an
empiric, in the staid city of Boston, acquired a great reputation
for wonderful cures, by giving calomel in very large
doses, even by the teaspoonful. His reputation was, of
course, short-lived; for, though he seemed to make some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
capital hits, so glaring an abuse of a good remedy could
not but be attended with bad results, occasionally of so
palpable a character, as to undeceive even the credulous
public.</p>

<p>The most prominent quack medicines are principally of
<em>three</em> kinds.</p>

<p>1. Evacuants. To this class belong the almost numberless
varieties of pills advertised in the newspapers. There
is a great similarity in the composition of these pills,
although each kind is ushered into notice with all the pretensions
of an entirely new discovery. Aloes, gamboge,
&amp;c., medicines in common use, form the basis of nearly
all of them. They are simply good cathartic preparations,
and have none of the extraordinary virtues attributed to
them. And, as those who are ailing are commonly benefitted
by producing some amount of cathartic effect, these
different pills actually do some good to quite a large proportion
of the cases to which they are applied. The difficulty
with them is, that used indiscriminately, as they so
generally are, they in many cases do injury, and in some
to a fatal extent.</p>

<p>2. The second class of quack medicines are those which
are supposed to act upon the system slowly, producing a
change in its general condition. The general term <em>alterative</em>
may be properly applied to them.</p>

<p>The various preparations of sarsaparilla belong to this
class. The same remark can be made in regard to these
that was made in relation to the great variety of popular
pills. They are all very much alike, although the proprietor
of each claims for his preparation that it is entirely
new in its combination, and that it is pre-eminently successful.
A single fact, which came to the knowledge of
the author, will show what kind of imposition some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
these discoverers of <em>new</em> preparations of sarsaparilla practice
upon the community. Twenty years ago, Carpenter’s
Fluid Extract of Sarsaparilla had a high reputation, both
with the profession and with the public. No secret was
made of its composition. A student of medicine copied
the formula. A few years ago he furnished an apothecary
with this formula, who forthwith came out before the public
with what purported to be a <em>new</em> preparation of sarsaparilla,
which, by the usual machinery of quackery, obtained
extensive popular favor, and made a fortune for the
apothecary. His preparation was not a new one, but was
made according to Carpenter’s formula, with some slight
additions to alter the taste and the appearance of the
medicine. The sale of this once famous preparation of
sarsaparilla has, with that of its rivals, almost, if not
wholly gone by; and others are now the candidates for
fame and <em>money</em> with their entirely <em>new</em> preparations.</p>

<p>3. As consumption is the most common of all chronic
diseases, there is a very large class of remedies which are
supposed to act especially upon the lungs. Each one of
these is claimed by its proprietor to be a <em>certain cure</em> for
this formidable disease. They are generally combinations
of articles which are in common use among physicians in
affections of the lungs. In the indiscriminate use to which
they are put by the empiric, while they benefit some cases
to which they <em>happen</em> to be appropriate, in the great
majority of instances they undoubtedly do harm; and in
the forming stage of many cases, they fasten the disease
irrecoverably, when a judicious and discriminating treatment
might have saved the patient. These nostrums,
therefore, add much to the mortality of consumption in
the community.</p>

<p>It is well understood by any one who proclaims the discovery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
of a new medicine for any disease, that his day of
prosperity must necessarily be short. He knows that his
medicine, whatever amount of popular favor it may
acquire, will soon be supplanted by some other <em>newly</em>-discovered
preparation. He must, therefore, make the
most of his time. Accordingly, as soon as he succeeds in
getting his name up by certificates, advertisements, &amp;c.,
he throws as large quantities as possible of his medicine
into market, and has but little care for the quality of the
materials of which it is made. Great quantities of sarsaparilla
and other articles which have been damaged, or
have become inert by age, are constantly used up in this
way, furnishing a profitable outlet for the refuse, which
accumulates annually in the shops of the dealers in such
articles. Large amounts, too, of adulterated articles are
used in the manufacture of quack remedies.</p>

<p>Another imposition of a kindred character deserves a
passing notice. When any particular article is high in
favor with the public, every empiric incorporates it into
the <em>name</em> which he gives to his medicine, in order to
ensure its popularity, though there may be little, perhaps
none, of the article used in its composition. If the article
command a high price, or if there be any difficulty in
obtaining it in sufficient quantity, other substances can
supply its place—the <em>name</em> is all that is essential to secure
a profitable sale of the medicine. Much of the sarsaparilla
which is sold, has little or none of the real Spanish
sarsaparilla in it; and as the Canchalagua of California is
now rising into notice, there will, undoubtedly, be much
sold as the genuine article, which will be composed of substances
that Californians never saw.</p>

<p>The fact that the quack’s advertisement is not only
ridiculously pompous and grandiloquent, but palpably false,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
does not seem to injure the sale of his medicine, even with
quite sensible people. A medical student in Boston
amused himself with writing a burlesque quack advertisement.
An apothecary, to whom he read it, proposed to
buy it of him, and said that he would prepare a medicine,
which, he had no doubt, could be sold in large quantities
by the aid of that advertisement. The young man was
astonished that his friend should suppose that any such use
could be made of what he intended should be so exceedingly
ridiculous. But the bargain was struck, the advertisement
was put forth, and the medicine was, for a time,
among the prominent quack remedies. Ridiculous as was
this burlesque advertisement, it has since been surpassed
by many of those which occupy so large a space in the
newspapers.</p>

<p>The certificates of cures, which are so important in giving
currency to quack medicines, may be divided into
<em>four</em> classes.</p>

<p>1. Some of these certificates are forgeries.</p>

<p>2. Many of them are essentially, sometimes wholly,
untrue. Some of this class are written by the local agents
of the proprietor; and the individuals are persuaded to
sign them, because the medicine had been gratuitously furnished,
or for some other reason. I know many facts
which I could adduce in proof of this statement. I will
mention, however, but one case. One who had been an
apothecary, and had sold large amounts of quack medicines,
stated, that in one year he sold three thousand
dollars’ worth of one medicine—that he had no satisfactory
proof of its having cured a single case of disease—that he
had obtained, however, many certificates of cure, but not
one from any person who had paid for the medicine.</p>

<p>3. Another class of certificates are obtained in this way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Invalids are very apt, on taking a new medicine, to imagine
themselves for a little time to be benefitted; but after a
while they find that it is mere imagination. Many certificates
are obtained of such persons at the time when they
feel encouraged in regard to their prospect of recovery.
The empiric understands that this is the golden opportunity
for him, and he will have no delay if it can be avoided.
It is astonishing what sensible people are sometimes caught
in this way. A deaf gentleman once asked me my opinion
of an empiric, who pretended to have uncommon skill in
the cure of deafness. He found, among the published
certificates, a letter from a gentleman of his acquaintance,
of the highest standing both in character and intellect,
expressing great gratitude for the relief which he had
experienced from the practice of this ear doctor. He
wrote to his friend a letter of inquiry. His friend replied,
that when he returned from his visit to this quack, he
thought himself to be somewhat better, and was so much
delighted that he magnified the improvement in his imagination,
and in this condition wrote that certificate; and
that he was now satisfied that he unwittingly made in that
certificate a really false representation of his case.</p>

<p>4. Another class of certificates come from those who
are really relieved while using the medicines, in regard to
which they certify. The inference, according to the ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post
hoc propter hoc</i>’ mode of reasoning is, that the medicines,
of course, cured them. I need not stop to show that this
inference can by no means always be a correct one. I
trust that the facts presented in the previous chapters are
sufficient to satisfy the reader on this point.</p>

<p>No class of men have done more harm by giving certificates
of cures by quack medicines, than clergymen.
They are so situated in the discharge of their parochial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
duties, that they are apt to be drawn into the signing of
such certificates. They hear the glowing statements recited
by patients and their friends. They, of course, sympathize
with the relieved sufferers. They do not sift and
examine the statements, for it seems almost unfeeling to
doubt. They often, therefore, give these statements full
credence, and furnish the empiric with certificates. Certificates
from such sources are highly prized, and are, therefore,
eagerly sought for. But clergymen should consider
what they are doing by this course. The facts which I
have stated show, that by such acts they uphold a system
of impositions, and help quackery to destroy the lives of
their fellow men.</p>

<p>The feeling which physicians manifest in regard to empiricism,
is very commonly supposed to be prompted by
self-interest. This is far from being true. It would not
be at all for the pecuniary interest of physicians to have
quackery suppressed; for it is continually furnishing them
with patients, in whom disease has been created or aggravated
by the use of empirical remedies.</p>

<p>I trust that it is obvious to the reader, from the facts
which I have stated, that the medical profession are right
in the ground which they have for the most part maintained
against secret and patent medicines. The rule
which they have adopted, in regard to themselves, on this
point, is thus given in Percival’s Medical Ethics: “No
physician or surgeon should dispense a secret nostrum,
whether it be his invention or exclusive property; for if it
be of real efficacy, the concealment of it is inconsistent
with beneficence and professional liberality. And if mystery
alone give it value and importance, such craft implies
either disgraceful ignorance or fraudulent avarice.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>This rule recognizes a very just distinction between
inventions in medicine and all other inventions. As
medicine has to do with such important interests as health
and life, the principles of benevolence demand, that any
invention or discovery in this art, should be promulgated
without any hindrance. And this is the more necessary,
because nearly all of the so-called <em>new</em> medicines, put forth
from time to time, have nothing new in them, and mystery
alone gives them their value and importance in the eyes
of the public. The claims which are set up for the great
mass of popular remedies, blazoned forth in newspaper,
pamphlet, almanac, and handbill so profusely, are gross
impositions; and an exposure of the formulas, according to
which these medicines are compounded, would show them
to be so.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>The only way in which this imposition, so constantly
practised upon the community, can be guarded against
effectually, is to oblige every one who sells a medicine, to
make the composition of it known on the wrapper in which
each parcel of the medicine is enclosed. Such a law is
now, I understand, in force in the State of Maine. I hope
that the law will be sustained, and that so just and noble
an example will everywhere be followed.</p>

<p>If it be objected that the inventor in medicine should,
like other inventors, have something more as a reward
than the consciousness of doing good, and the reputation
which his invention gives him, this can be provided for
without any difficulty. Let a board be constituted, whose
duty it shall be to examine all medicines offered to them,
rejecting all that have nothing new in material or in the
form of combination, and recommending all that are really
valuable. Let it also be the duty of this board to award
to the proprietor of every medicine, which they approve, as
being a real invention or discovery, a suitable sum to be paid
him out of the public treasury. Such a board, constituted
on the most liberal principles that any one could desire,
would find but few among the multitude of remedies now
before the public, of which they could conscientiously
approve; and there would be no ground for fear of any
great drain upon the public treasury, by the awards which
they would make to inventors.</p>

<p>Quackery has, at length, come to be so monstrous an
evil, that there will be great difficulty in removing it. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
credulity of the public is so great and so extensive, that
the plainest and strongest facts, brought out even in multitudinous
array, are almost powerless before it. Then, too,
the capital invested in this vast system of imposture is
large in amount. It has become one of the great interests
in the community,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and is so linked in with other interests
in the relations of business, as to have a strong hold in
this way upon the public. It has even subsidized the
press; and it has done it so thoroughly, that it has not
only muzzled it, so far as speaking out the truth on this
subject is concerned, but it has compelled it to utter freely
the falsehoods which it demands for its purposes. I speak
of our secular newspapers. If there are any that are not
guilty, they are exceptions. There may be a few. I
know of not one. Not content with advertising quack
medicines, they, for a liberal fee, admit into their columns,
articles which have the appearance of editorial recommendations;
and these are copied as such into advertisements
in other newspapers. And besides all this, respectable
editors have often refused to publish any exposure of
the impositions of quackery. Our legislators, too, are
afraid to move in any way against a system of impostures
which has so strong a hold upon the community. Still,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
though these formidable obstacles are in the way of a radical
reform on this subject, let the facts continue to be
brought out, and let the truth be told fearlessly; and this
evil, grown now to be so monstrous, will at length yield
to our efforts.</p>

<p>I have thus far spoken of only one form of quackery—the
sale of secret medicines. It appears in various other
forms. I shall give some examples of only a few of them.</p>

<p>Many empirics have become itinerant lecturers. They,
of course, always have something to sell—books, medicines,
braces, breathing-tubes, &amp;c. Their lectures are
partly, sometimes wholly, gratuitous, which, certainly,
looks like being somewhat benevolent. The lectures are
made up of some very plain truths, borrowed from some
medical works, which, mingled with some popular errors,
and spiced with the prevailing ultraism of the present day,
in order to make them interesting, are urged upon the
audience as being both new and important. A variety of
illustrations and analogies, some of which are true and
some merely plausible, are made use of to effect the lecturer’s
purpose; which is, to convince the audience that
he has examined the subject particularly, and is a thorough
master of it. If he succeed in doing this, there is a great
rush of invalids to his rooms in the intervals of his lectures.
His remedies are costly, but his advice is gratuitous;
and this is commonly a very successful bait for the
poor invalid. He receives a large amount of money from
his numerous patients for what cost him but very little.
For the time being, he is the great medical lion of the
place. But great as he is, when he is once gone, he is
gone never to return to that place again: his vocation
<em>there</em> is ended.</p>

<p>Some of these empirical lecturers have, as a special attraction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
one or two lectures particularly for the ladies, to
which no gentleman can be admitted; and one or two also
for gentlemen, from which the ladies are excluded. I will
only say, that in every case in which I have known this to
be done, the character of the lectures has been such as no
virtuous community should tolerate.</p>

<p>Animal magnetism, as applied to medicine, has made
quite a figure in the world of quackery. Miss Martineau,
and many other people reputed to be very sensible, have
been entrapped by this delusion. The magnetized subject,
or clairvoyant, who attends the lecturer on this “science,”
in his travels, is said to be able to look into the sick, and
see exactly what is going on there. If this be so, animal
magnetism must be capable of rendering essential aid in
investigating disease—more essential, indeed, than any
other means which we have at our command; and every
physician should have his clairvoyant to attend him in his
daily visits. The hits which are sometimes made by clairvoyants,
are said to be astonishing; but they are so for
precisely the same reason that the hits of the fortuneteller
are sometimes truly wonderful. The clairvoyant
has ears, and can hear what may be said aloud or in
whisper about different invalids; and the magnetizer can
hear for her.</p>

<p>I will give an example or two, to show what convenient
use can be made of ears by these clairvoyants.</p>

<p>I once heard a lecturer state the case of a young man,
who, he said, had for a long time suffered severe pain, and
had applied to many physicians without obtaining any
relief, or any satisfactory explanation of his case. His
clairvoyant at once directed that a particular tooth be removed,
and said that an abscess could then be opened above
it, the discharge of which would relieve the pain. This was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
done, and the patient was relieved. Every one supposed,
from his manner of relating the case, that no one had ever
hinted at the real seat of the disease, and that it was a
fresh discovery of his clairvoyant. It was found, however,
that physicians had taken this view of the case, and that it
had been talked about in the family. The clairvoyant, probably,
got her knowledge by her ears, before she was put
into the ‘magnetic state.’</p>

<p>A very shrewd lady accompanied a friend on a visit to
a clairvoyant, in Boston, whom she wished to consult in
regard to her child, who had, by a fall, injured his side.
She watched the proceedings of the parties very narrowly.
The clairvoyant was for some time quite in the dark about
the case, and used very indefinite language in regard to it.
At length her mind became suddenly clear in its views;
and it <em>seemed</em> to be done by a whisper uttered by one of
the party to another, in relation to the fall. She at once
said, “The child must have had some accident—he fell
down, and as he stretched out his hands, he struck on his
chest, <em>and the bones have shot by each other</em>.” The clairvoyant
went a little too far. There is no such thing as
the shooting by of any bones in the chest, at least in any
ordinary accident. These clairvoyants, that see right into
people, often have an anatomy of their own.</p>

<p>We sometimes have an opportunity of testing the clearness
of the medical vision of these clairvoyants. One of
them, a few years since, on examining the case of a child,
saw in its intestines three kinds of worms, which she described
with great exactness. It was a very clear and distinct
vision. The child died two days after, and I assisted
in its examination after death. The worms, so distinctly
seen, were not to be found. The magnetizer and his clairvoyant
immediately left for another field of labor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>Some names have become quite celebrated in the annals
of quackery. I will give a passing notice to a few of
them.</p>

<p>Paracelsus has been called the prince of quacks. He
flourished in the beginning of the sixteenth century. In order
to give himself dignity, he assumed the names of Philippus,
Aureolus, Theophrastes, Paracelsus, Bombastes de Hohenheim.
He discarded all the commonly-received doctrines
and modes of practice, and pretended to have been searching
after the truth for many years. He put forth a pompous
proclamation of his travels and researches, and pretended
to have made great acquisitions in medical science.
The remedies which he used were mostly of the <em>heroic</em>
kind; and though he killed many by his rash practice, he
stumbled on some great cures, (and what quack has not?).
These were proclaimed in the most bombastic manner.
The result was that his practice was immense in amount
and extent. The magistrates of Basle engaged him, at a
large salary, to fill the chair of medicine in their university.
At his first lecture he burned the works of Galen and
Avicenna, and asserted that there was more knowledge in
his <em>cap</em> than in the heads of all physicians, and that there
was more experience in his <em>beard</em> than in all the universities.
“Greeks, Romans, French and Italians,” said he,
“you Avicenna, you Galen, you Rhazes, you Mesne—you
doctors of Paris, you of Montpelier, you of Swabia, you
of Prussia, you of Cologne, you of Vienna—and all you
throughout the countries that are washed by the Danube
and the Rhine, and you who inhabit the islands of the sea,
Athenian, Greek, Arab, and Jew: you shall follow and
obey me: I am your king—<em>the monarchy of physic is
mine</em>!”</p>

<p>Though he did not long retain his professorship, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
though he was grossly intemperate in the last years of his
life, he maintained his reputation for extraordinary cures
even to his death. Great and learned men were among
his patients, and even the noted Erasmus consulted this arrant
charlatan.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>It is but a few years ago that St. John Long had immense
multitudes of patients in London, though his notions were
of the most ridiculous character, and were attacked with
the shafts of reason and ridicule on every side. His theory
was, that all diseases were produced by a semi-mercurial
fluid, and that in order to cure the disease, the seat of this
fluid must be found, and the fluid must in some way be got
out. He had discovered a very summary way of doing
this. He used a liniment, which he applied over the seat
of the fluid, and extracted it at once. Though this liniment
had such wonderful power, it would produce no effect
when applied over a part which was not diseased—so that
in any case, in which the seat of the disease was not obvious,
instead of going through with a strict and long investigation
after the vulgar way of regular doctors, St. John
Long only had to apply his liniment here and there, till he
found that the disease was extracted. One would hardly
suppose that such nonsense could be believed in any civilized
community; but the theory of this painter, who had
thrown aside his brush and dubbed himself doctor, ridiculous
as it was, found such favor with the public, that the
prominent journals came out with weighty articles against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
it. Reasoning was not only in vain, but worse than in
vain. The wonder grew—it was not put down. Quackery
never yet was <em>killed</em>—it always <em>dies a natural death</em>,
and so did the quackery of St. John Long. After running
the gauntlet amidst the heavy blows of wise and powerful
enemies, and coming forth unharmed at every heat, it at
length laid itself down, and died the most quiet death imaginable.
It fell asleep; and this is the end of all quackery.</p>

<p>Who has not heard of Perkins’ Tractors? The inventor,
Doctor Elisha Perkins, was born in the town where the author
resides. He was the son of a physician, who was for
forty years in extensive practice, and was himself, for some
time a respectable physician in the town of Plainfield in this
State. He was undoubtedly an honest man. He duped
others, it is true, but he duped himself, too. He was a deluded
enthusiast, and died a victim to his enthusiasm only
three years after he published to the world his grand ‘discovery.’
He had conceived the idea that a free use of salt
as an antiseptic would cure the yellow fever. He therefore
went to New York in the year 1799, when this disease was
raging, and, full of confidence in his mode of practice, offered
his services most generously to the poor as well as the
rich. At the end of four weeks he himself caught the fever,
and being exhausted by his labors he survived but four days
after his attack.</p>

<p>The promulgation of Dr. Perkins’ ‘discovery,’ which
occurred in 1796, was preceded, it is said, by a long series
of experiments, which were suggested by the supposition,
that metallic substances might remove disease by some
electrical or galvanic power. The Tractors, which were
the final result of these experiments, are two pieces of metal
about three inches long, blunt at one end, and running to a
point at the other. One of them appears to be brass, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
the other steel, but what their real composition is, is not
known, as the invention was patented.</p>

<p>The fame of the Tractors spread with unaccountable
rapidity, and marvelous cures were everywhere reported.
Certificates came in from all quarters, and from all kinds
of dignitaries. Not only captains, and colonels, and generals,
and ’squires sounded the praises of the Tractors, but
clergymen and senators and doctors and professors. And
their fame was not confined to this country. Benjamin
Douglass Perkins, a son of the inventor, went to London
to obtain the patronage of the British public for the Tractors.
Great cures were forthwith effected all over the
kingdom, of which there were multitudes of certificates
from the wise and good, and, what is better, from the titled
and wealthy. Similar cures were also reported from other
countries in Europe, especially from Denmark.</p>

<p>To prove that imagination had nothing to do with these
results, there were related many instances of cure in infants
and in horses. It was found by some sage observer that,
though horses could be cured by the Tractors, they had
no influence at all upon sheep. He supposes that this is
owing to the unctuous matter in the wool, and he remarks
that “even pomatum, it is well ascertained, prevents the
Tractors from relieving pains in that part of the head over
which the pomatum is used.” A lame crow, supposed to
have the cramp, was operated upon so successfully by the
Tractors, that though he had not been able to put his foot
to the ground for a week, he walked perfectly well the next
morning after the application.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>The multitude of cases which were collected from every
quarter were occasionally published. I have in my possession
a volume of nearly two hundred pages published in
London, containing a great number of these cases. The
testimony is of the most decisive character. Pain was relieved
in a trice by a few strokes of the Tractors; inflammations
were drawn out; swellings were dispersed, and, in
some cases, with such rapidity that they were <em>seen</em> to lessen
during the application; rheumatism, which had baffled the
best medical skill was removed; the paralytic was made to
walk—such were the reports which were constantly put
forth.</p>

<p>The success of the Tractors was attested not only by
multitudes of wealthy and titled and learned men, but even
by many of the medical profession; and selfish motives
were unhesitatingly attributed to all physicians who were
unbelievers. A physician, who was of sufficient respectability
to be a president of a medical society, said of such
unbelievers, that “like <em>infidels</em> to the gospel, they admit of no
mysteries, and refuse to believe what they do not readily
comprehend.” Dr. Haygarth, an eminent physician of
Bath, and some others, drew down a storm of public wrath
upon their heads, because they asserted that a pair of
wooden Tractors, painted so as to resemble the real metallic
ones, had produced in their hands as marked effects as those
which were purchased of Mr. Benjamin Douglass Perkins,
at five guineas a pair. So strong was the hold which ‘the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
new science of Perkinism,’ as it was called, had obtained
upon the public favor, that the son of the inventor of the
Tractors was spoken of as being most unjustly persecuted
by a large proportion of the medical profession; and his
name was often associated with those of Galileo and Harvey
and Jenner, who, it was said, had suffered like persecution
before him, from the stereotyped hatred of everything
that is new.</p>

<p>The efficacy of the Tractors was almost universally acknowledged;
and the only difficulty seemed to be to account
for their operation. Many ingenious electrical and
galvanic theories were broached by learned men in England
and in other countries. Perkinism, as it was called
by acclamation, was hailed as one of the greatest of discoveries,
and it was supposed to form a new era in medicine.
The Tractors were sold in abundance at five guineas
a pair. That the poor might be benefitted equally with the
rich, the liberality of the British public was appealed to,
and not in vain. A ‘Perkinean Institution’ was formed
under the patronage of the first men in the kingdom.
Lord Rivers was president, and there is a long list of titled
vice presidents.</p>

<p>A pamphlet, giving an account of this institution was
published, of which I have a copy. The regulations were
evidently based upon the idea that it was to be a permanent
establishment. One of them prescribes that a donation of
ten guineas constitute a governor for <em>life</em>. As many ladies
were very enthusiastic patrons of the Tractors, as they are
now of infinitesimal globules, one of the regulations was,
that “ladies have liberty to vote by proxy, given to any
governor of the institution, or by letter to the chairman.”</p>

<p>In this account it is stated that the published cases of
cures by the Tractors up to March, 1802, amounted to about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
five thousand. “Supposing,” the author goes on to say,
“that not more that one cure in three hundred, which the
Tractors have performed has been published, and the proportion
is probably much greater, it will be seen that the
number, to March, 1802, will have exceeded one million
five hundred thousand. It is believed that no medical remedy
ever yet discovered has been supported by so many
well-authenticated and important cures, performed in so
short a time.”</p>

<p>And now, I ask, where is the Perkinean Institution,
with its troop of governors for life, and where is the Perkinean
practice, with its list of five thousand published
cures? The institution expired while the governors for
life were almost to a man in the land of the living; and in
less than ten years after the summing up of the five thousand
cures, Perkinism was only thought of as a thing that
was past, and the far-famed Tractors were almost forgotten.</p>

<p>And what became of Benjamin Douglass Perkins, who
suffered for the cause of science and humanity such persecution
as Galileo and Harvey and Jenner suffered before
him? He returned to his native land with ten thousand
pounds of John Bull’s money, as a reward of his patient
endurance of persecution, and his active benevolence!</p>

<p>I might extend this notice of names which have been famous
in the history of quackery, but it is not necessary.
Those which I have noticed will answer as illustrations of
the mode in which medical delusions obtain their hold upon
the public mind, and of the facility with which each in its
turn is supplanted by some other. The essential materials
of quackery, as I remarked in the Preface, have been the
same in all ages; and its history would be only a description
of the endless forms into which these materials have
been moulded. Great as is the variety in the series of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
phantasmagoria with which quackery has excited the wonder of
the world, they have all been produced upon the
same canvas, and by the same old magic lantern.</p>

<p>And busy and multiform as quackery has been, and lofty
as have been its claims, I know not that it has ever made a
<em>single discovery in medicine</em>. It may possibly have <em>stumbled</em>
upon some discovery, but I am not aware that it has
done even this. On the other hand, all the discoveries
which have been made in the medical art, so far as I know,
have been the results of a truly scientific observation, and
fairly belong to that ‘regular’ profession, which so many
consider as being opposed to everything which is new.</p>



<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> The following anecdote of an ignoramus, who set himself up as a
doctor, furnishes a good illustration of this erroneous mode of reasoning.
His first case was that of a butcher, who recovered. As he gave his
patient beefsteak and wine quite liberally, he referred the cure to these
articles, and put down in his note-book—beefsteak and wine will cure a
<em>butcher</em>. His next case was that of a tailor, which, under the same
treatment, resulted unsuccessfully. He, therefore, added to the above
note—but will kill a <em>tailor</em>.</p>

<p>You laugh at the use which this man made of the ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post hoc propter hoc</i>’
mode of reasoning; but, after all, his inference is no farther from the
truth than many of the inferences of wise dabblers in physic, promulgated
in the newspapers, or even of learned doctors, gravely recorded in the
annals of medicine. The only real difference is, that among the many
preceding circumstances, to which results might be attributed, he chose
one, and they chose some other, a little more plausible, perhaps, than his,
but no nearer the truth.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> The whole course of the medical profession, in regard to discoveries
in medicine, has been open and generous, and not secret and mercenary.
Dr. Stevens, in his eloquent address before the New York State Medical
Society, thus speaks on this point: “Was the introduction of inoculation
for the small-pox a speculation? Was the discovery of the preventive
power of vaccination, (the labor of close, unremitting, and careful research
during a period of several years,)—was that made or conducted
with a view to personal emolument? As a matter of course, Dr. Jenner,
as soon as he had completed his discovery, published it—made it free to
all mankind. When quinine was first discovered, the mode of preparing
it was immediately made known. Recently, when some feeble attempts
were made to obtain a patent for the use of ether, and to conceal the process
of etherization, the indignation of the profession was aroused from
one end of our country to the other. The money changers were driven
from the temple of humanity.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> For example, the famous <em>Balm of Gilead</em>, which, in its time, was
said to cure all manner of disease, is nothing but brandy spiced with cardamoms
and other like seeds, and made a little more stimulating with
Spanish flies. The use of this medicine, therefore, was really only one
of the modes of dram drinking.</p>

<p>Louis XV. purchased, for a considerable sum, of Madame Nouffleur, a
nostrum for the cure of tape-worm. The medicine proved to be the powder
of the male fern, which was used for the same complaint by Galen in
the second century, but which, in spite of the recommendations of this
illustrious physician, and the princely reward paid to Madame Nouffleur
for her discovery of it—in, shall I say, some musty book—it has somehow
lost its reputation.</p>

<p>Examples of the same kind might be given almost indefinitely.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> A few facts will show the present enormous growth of this interest.
Ten years ago, the revenue of the English government, from the sale of
patent medicines, was only a little short of fifty thousand pounds sterling.
The cost of advertising quack medicines in the United States, was estimated
at that time at 200,000 dollars. But it is vastly more now. Dr.
Stevens, in his recent address states, that the advertising outlay of some
of the most notorious patent medicine proprietors, is reckoned by its fifty
and hundred thousand dollars per annum. Quack advertisements occupy
a large space in our newspapers. In the twenty columns of a country political
paper published tri-weekly, I once counted eleven filled with such
advertisements, while only nine were devoted to other advertisements,
news, miscellaneous matters, editorials, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> After he left his professional chair, he wandered about the country,
generally intoxicated, seldom changing his clothes, or even going to bed.
And though like other quacks who have succeeded him, he boasted that he
had discovered a <em>panacea</em>, which would cure all disease at once, and even
prolong life almost indefinitely, this prince of empirics died after a few
hours’ illness, in the forty-eighth year of his age, at Salzburg in Bavaria,
with a bottle of his panacea in his pocket.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> At one time live toads were a popular remedy for hemorrhage, tied
behind the ears, or under the arm pits, or to the soles of the feet. It was
supposed by some that the effect was altogether mental. But, as in the
case of the Tractors, it was contended that this could not be so, because
the same effect was produced upon animals. Michael Mercatus asserts
that “if you hang the toad round a cock’s neck for a day or so, you may
then cut off his head, and <em>the neck will not bleed a single drop</em>.” One
cannot help being reminded by this of the experiments with the <em>Brocchieri
water</em> a year or two since upon animals, which, though reported as
perfectly successful, have not saved this remedy from going to the tomb of
the Capulets, to which all its predecessors have gone before it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br>
<span class="fs80">THOMPSONISM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Thompsonism, or Thomsonianism, as it is more often
called, or written, is a system of quackery, which, though
it is evidently declining in public favor, is still so prominent,
that it seems to merit a separate notice.</p>

<p>The principles of this system shall be stated in the language
of its founder.</p>

<p>“My system of practice is founded upon these few, simple,
and I think, just principles.</p>

<p>1st. That the constitutions of all mankind are essentially
alike, and differ only in the different temper of the same
materials of which they are composed. The materials, of
which all men are formed, may be resolved into the four elements.
Earth and water constitute the solids of the body,
which is made active by air and fire. And this last element
in a peculiar manner gives life and motion to the rest;
and when entirely overpowered, from whatever cause, by
the other elements, death ensues.</p>

<p>2d. That the construction and organization of the human
frame is in all men essentially the same. They have similar
solids and fluids, viz., bones, cartilages, tendons, nerves,
muscles, veins, arteries, flesh, blood, and other juices, body
and parts, or members.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>3d. That all are sustained in a manner as similar as their
formation, from the earth, the common mother of us all.
Of the elements man is made, and by the same elements he
is supported.</p>

<p>4th. That a state of perfect health arises from a due
balance or temperature of these elements. But when it is
by any means destroyed, the body is more or less disordered.
And when this is the case, there is always an actual
diminution or absence of the element, fire or heat, and in
proportion to this diminution or absence, the body is affected
with its opposite, cold. The former may be denominated
nature itself, the best physician of the body, the
latter its enemy; the first is the health and life of the body;
the last its disease and death.</p>

<p>5th. That all diseases, however various the symptoms,
and different the names by which they are called, arise
directly from obstructed perspiration. The many evils derived
from hence, must be obvious, when it is considered
that the discharge from the body thereby is greater than by
all the other evacuations combined. Obstructed perspiration
may be produced from a great variety of effects which
produce the same cause, originating from cold.</p>

<p>Now as all men have similar constitutions, being formed
of the same materials differently tempered; as their construction
and organization essentially agree; as they are all
sustained from the same elements which form their composition;
as a just balance or temperature of these elements
produces a state of health, and the reverse destroys it; as
all disease takes its immediate rise from obstructed perspiration
in a greater or less degree; and as this is an effect
universally produced, it is evident that those medicines
which are most agreeable to nature, and efficacious in removing
obstructions, and the evils thereby produced, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
restoring the perfect equilibrium, activity and energy of the
system, must be the best, and universally applicable.</p>

<p>I shall now describe the fuel which continues the <em>fire</em> or
<em>life</em> of man. This is contained in two things—<em>food</em> and
<em>medicine</em>, which are in harmony with each other, often
grow in the same field, and are created to be used by the
same people. People who are capable of raising their food
and preparing the same, may as easily learn to collect and
prepare their own medicine, and administer the same when
it is needed. Our life depends on heat; food is the fuel
that kindles and continues that heat. The digestive powers
being correct causes the food to consume; this continues
the warmth of the body, by continually supporting the
fire.</p>

<p>The stomach is the <em>deposit</em> from which the whole body is
supported. The heat is kindled in the stomach by its consuming
the food; and all the body and limbs receive their proportion
of nourishment and heat from that source; as the
whole room is warmed by the fire which is consumed in
the fire-place. The greater the quantity of wood consumed
in the fire-place, the greater the heat in the whole room.
So in the body; the more food <em>well digested</em>, the more heat
and support through the whole man. But by constantly
receiving food into the stomach, which is sometimes not
suitable for the best nourishment, the stomach becomes
foul, so that the food is not well digested. This causes the
body to lose its heat; then the appetite fails; the bones
ache, and the man is sick in every part of the whole frame.</p>

<p>This situation of the body shows the need of <em>medicine</em>,
and the <em>kind</em> needed; which is such as will clear the <em>stomach</em>
and <em>bowels</em>, and restore the <em>digestive organs</em>. When
this is done, the food will raise the heat again and nourish
the whole man. All the art required to do this is to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
what <em>medicine</em> will do it, and how to administer it, as a
person knows how to clear a stove and the pipe when
clogged with soot, that the fire may burn free, and the whole
room be warmed as before.</p>

<p>The medicines best calculated to have the desired effect
are such as will raise and retain the vital heat of the system,
remove obstructions, promote perspiration, clear off
the canker, and restore the digestive powers. These can
only be found in vegetable substances; and there can
enough be found in all countries to answer every purpose
needed. I have devoted the greatest part of my life to ascertain
those articles that are best to answer the above purposes;
and these may be found in my Book of Practice,
properly classed under the heads of the different numbers,
with directions for preparing and administering them in
curing all cases of disease, which has been secured to me
by patent. Family rights will be sold, and the <em>necessary
information given</em> to enable those who purchase to practice
with safety and success, by application to me or any of my
agents duly authorized.”</p>

<p>Such is the statement of the <em>principles</em> of Thompson’s
theory. The <em>principle</em> contained in the last sentence,
touching the sale of family rights, was the favorite one, the
<em>golden</em> one in his eyes, and he fought for it manfully. He
made no blunder in putting this among the <em>principles</em> of
his <em>practice</em>.</p>

<p>Appended to this ‘statement’ are some ‘Remarks on
Fevers,’ which it is not necessary to copy entire.</p>

<p>“No person,” says Dr. Thompson, “ever yet died of a
fever! for as death approaches, the patient grows cold, until
in death the last spark is extinguished. This the learned
doctors cannot deny; and as this is true, they ought in justice
to acknowledge that their whole train of depletive remedies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
such as bleeding, blistering, physicking, starving, with
all their refrigeratives; their opium, mercury, arsenic, antimony,
nitre, &amp;c., are so many deadly engines combined
with the disease, against the constitution and life of the
patient. If cold, which is the commonly received opinion,
(and which is true,) is the cause of fever, to repeatedly
bleed the patient, and administer mercury, opium, nitre,
and other refrigerants, to restore him to health, is, as though
a man should, to increase a fire in his room, throw a part
of it out of the house, and to increase the remainder, put
on water, snow and ice!”</p>

<p>And again—“There is no more difference in all cases of
fever than what is caused by the different degrees of cold,
or loss of inward heat, which are two adverse parties in one
body contending for power. If the heat gains the victory,
the cold will be disinherited, and health will be restored;
but on the other hand, if cold gains the ascendancy, heat
will be dispossessed of its empire, and death will follow of
course.</p>

<p>“The higher the fever runs, the sooner will the cold be
subdued; and if you contend against the heat, the longer
will be the run of the fever, and when extinguished, death
follows.”</p>

<p>When a patient dies of fever, Thompson says, “the
question whether the heat or the cold killed the patient is
easily decided, for that power which bears rule in the body
after death, is what killed the patient, which is cold—as
much as that which bears rule when he is alive, is heat.”</p>

<p>Again he says, “At the commencement of a fever, by
direct and proper application of suitable medicine, it can be
easily and speedily removed. Twenty-four, or forty-eight
hours, to the extent, are sufficient, and often short of that
time, the fever may be removed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>Now see how confident this bold reformer is in the truth
of these assertions. “These declarations,” says he, “are
true, and have been often proved, and can be again, to the
satisfaction of every candid person <span class="allsmcap">AT THE HAZARD OF ANY
FORFEITURE THE FACULTY MAY CHALLENGE</span>.”</p>

<p>I have but a remark or two to make upon this theory of
Dr. Thompson.</p>

<p>It is rather a rude and unscientific theory. There is a
trifling mistake in calling such <em>compounds</em> as earth, air,
water and fire <em>elements</em>. Still, as a theory, it is quite as
rational as most of the theories spun from the more refined
brains of some of Thompson’s enemies, the ‘regulars,’ as
they are styled by his erudite followers; and I may say too
that it is quite as good a guide in actual practice. But this
point I shall speak of in another place.</p>

<p>Thompson makes great account of ‘obstructed perspiration’
in his theory. ‘All diseases,’ he says, ‘arise directly’
from it. It is difficult to conceive what he does in his
theory with the cold <em>sweat</em> of death; with the <em>sweating</em>
sickness, as it was called, once so extensively prevalent and
so fatal; with the colliquative <em>sweat</em>, always so bad a symptom
in disease, though there may be heat enough with it to
satisfy the most <em>ardent</em> Thompsonian; or with the <em>sweat</em> of
rheumatism, so unapt to bring relief to the disease. In all
these cases, there is certainly <em>un</em>obstructed perspiration,
and yet it does not remedy the disease, as it should do,
according to the Thompsonian theory.</p>

<p>While he considers fire or heat as life, he thinks that
the ‘obstructed perspiration’ always ‘originates from <em>cold</em>,’
which he seems to personify as a sort of master spirit,
producing all disease—it is the ‘legion,’ which his medicines,
and his alone, are fitted to overcome and dispossess.
With him, heat and cold are the two combatants that fight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
in the battle of disease. And while the doctors, he says,
‘assist the cold to kill the patient,’ under his practice, ‘the
heat gains the victory, the cold is disinherited, and health is
restored.’</p>

<p>The fact, that the ‘obstructed perspiration’ is often
made free by cooling medicines, or by the direct application
of cold to the skin, and thus, disease is relieved, (a fact which
is as well known to common observers, as it is to ‘doctors,’
and which is directly in the face of his theory,) I suppose
he flatly denies, as he asserts in regard to fever, that ‘if you
contend against the heat, the longer will be the run of the
fever, and when extinguished, death follows.’</p>

<p>It is rather difficult for the unskilled mind of a ‘regular’
to reconcile with the ‘simple and plain theory’ of Thompson,
these facts—that persons sometimes die with a great
degree of heat upon them—that heat sometimes remains in
the body for a long time after death—that in the cholera
there is occasionally found after death a great amount of
heat, though the patient’s body was very cold for many
hours before death, &amp;c. I once asked a Thompsonian the
reason of this last fact. ‘Why,’ said he, ‘that is plain
enough—the disease was so powerful it kept down the heat,
but when the patient died, the disease let go, and then the
heat came out.’ The answer was at least ingenious. But
Thompson says, ‘if the heat gains the victory, the cold will
be disinherited, and health will be restored.’ The warm
corpse of the cholera patient ought, therefore, to have revived.</p>

<p>It is asserted by the followers of Thompson, that there is
no need of ‘learned doctors.’ They declare that ‘the whole
theory and practice, is perfectly plain and simple, requiring
no study of the dead languages to comprehend it, thereby
enabling any person of common capacity to practice with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
a certainty of success, in all ordinary cases of disease, and
this too with but a few hours instruction.’ And, Thompson
himself speaks of the art of medicine, as being as plain
and as easy, as the clearing of ‘a stove and the pipe, when
clogged with soot.’</p>

<p>The Thompsonian system dispenses with the services of
‘learned doctors,’ for another reason also. It claims that,
while other medicines invariably injure the system, the
Thompsonian remedies always benefit it, both in sickness
and in health. No matter how much they are used, nor at
what times—they always do good, for they have, it is claimed,
a natural relation to the system. Many Thompsonians
carry this idea still farther than this. A prominent physician
of this class, one sufficiently orthodox and accomplished
to be for a long time an editor of one of their papers,
attributed a sort of selecting power to lobelia. He said,
that it would never bring up anything that it ought not to
bring up, and that if a man with a foul stomach, should eat
a good dinner, and then take lobelia, nothing but the bad
matter would be thrown off, and the dinner would stay there
to nourish the system.</p>

<p>Such views as these, being prevalent among Thompsonians,
both in regard to education and to the administration
of medicine, it is not strange that Thompsonian practitioners
should be a very ignorant set of men. In the remarks,
which their special hatred for mineral medicines, leads them
to make, they sometimes confound mineral and vegetable
substances together. A Thompsonian of some considerable
note, finding that a patient was applying hot camphor
cloths to her side to relieve pain, said with an air of authority,
‘away with your camphor—none of your <em>minerals</em>
where I am.’—‘What <em>shall</em> we put on doctor?’ asked a
by-stander. ‘A hot bag of salt,’ said he. What <em>vegetable</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
mine the salt came from I did not learn. So too, a Thompsonian
lecturer told his hearers, that he disapproved of <em>all</em>
mineral medicines, such as mercury, <em>opium</em>, arsenic, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We occasionally hear some singular reasoning from
Thompsonians in regard to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i> of medicines.
Though this is confessedly a very difficult subject,
they claim to know all about it, and give their opinions in
regard to it without any hesitation. A patient once told
me that, among the many physicians of whom she had suffered
many things was a Thompsonian of considerable celebrity.
He assured her that he could effect a cure in a very
short time. He began his treatment with the process of
steaming. Some heated bricks wrapped in wet flannel were
placed around her in bed. Presently some one asked
‘what is it that smells so?’—‘O’ said the doctor, ‘it is the
smell of the disease coming out through the pores—things
are working nicely—this is just as I want to have it. Disease
very often comes out in this way, through the pores,
and sometimes I have known the smell to be so strong, that
you could hardly stay in the room.’ As he went on to give
his clinical lecture on ‘disease coming out through the
pores,’ the smell grew worse and worse, as if to give emphasis
to his remarks. But at length some one suggested
that it was a little like the smell of burnt flannel, and on examination,
it was found that one of the bricks had scorched
the flannel which was around it. She at once told the doctor,
that she had no farther use for his services, for if he did
not know enough to distinguish between the smell of ‘disease
coming out through the pores,’ and the smell of burnt
flannel, he did not know enough to doctor her.</p>

<p>This system of quackery has obtained a large share of its
popularity, by the appeal which it has made to two forms
of popular sentiment, which have been for some time peculiarly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
prevalent. I refer to the sentiment of <em>radicalism</em>, and
to the prejudice against <em>mineral</em> medicines.</p>

<p>As it has been fashionable in the world of business and
politics, to denounce moneyed corporations, as being monopolies,
so that system of institutions, or corporations (as
they may be termed,) by which a well educated medical
profession is secured to the community, has also been denounced
and attacked by this same spirit of radicalism.
Thompsonism has been one of the principal channels
through which this attack has been made. The followers
of Thompson have always spoken of the medical faculty as
a privileged order, which must be overthrown, and down
with ‘regularism’ has been the chief motto on their banner
of ‘reform.’ All this, however, comes with an ill grace
from them, for the ‘venerated founder’ of their system began
his career with as sheer a monopoly as ever existed—a
patent securing to him the power of selling rights for twenty
dollars each, to every family; and the last days of this
‘reformer’ were embittered by a quarrel on this point, with
some of his agents. And, besides this, his followers have
adopted the very ‘regularism’ for which they have professed
to have so holy an abhorrence. It is Thompsonian ‘regularism’
it is true, but nevertheless it <em>is</em> ‘regularism.’ Like
the ‘regulars,’ against whom they have waged such an uncompromising
war, they have now in Connecticut, and I
suppose in other states also, their State Society, and their
board of Censors for the examination of candidates; and
they put the badge of ‘regularism’ upon these candidates,
by giving them a ‘regular’ diploma. The truth is, that
they found that so many of the class who are too lazy to
work were coming from the workshop and the field, dubbing
themselves at once Thompsonian physicians, that the
business was getting to be overdone. Hence the necessity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
of some restrictions. And it is <em>restrictions</em> which constitute
the ‘regularism,’ the ‘monopoly,’ against which they
have always declaimed.</p>

<p>Thompsonians have made much use of the popular prejudice
against <em>mineral</em> medicines. This prejudice has arisen
in part from the evils which have been seen to result from
the <em>abuse</em> of calomel. This remedy is so effectual an one in
many diseases, that it has been used more freely, and with
less caution, than it should be; and disastrous effects have
sometimes followed this abuse of it. But the same reasoning
which prohibits the cautious use of this article, on
account of the results which come from its incautious use,
would prohibit the use of horses, fire, steam, &amp;c., because,
through carelessness and want of skill, horses run away,
conflagrations take place, and steam boilers burst. Still
this groundless reasoning is applied by a large portion of
the community to this remedy. And this prejudice against
calomel has been extended to mineral medicines generally.
So extensive is this prejudice, that the quack of every name
is sure to appeal to it, and he, therefore, puts in his advertisement,
the assurance that his medicine is ‘entirely vegetable,’
as a necessary passport to public favor. Many physicians,
too, disgracefully yield to the prejudice of the people
in this respect. They pretend to give no calomel, or
almost none of it; and yet, such physicians generally give
more of this article, than those who pursue an open and
manly course on this subject.</p>

<p>In the clamor which has been raised against ‘mineral
doctors’ Thompsonians have been among the loudest.
They uniformly speak of minerals, as if they were deleterious
<em>because</em> they are minerals. Their chemistry, which,
as you have seen, recognizes the existence of only four elements,
has not, I suppose, taught them, that their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
bodies are partly composed of minerals, that there is lime
in the bones, and iron in the blood, that minerals exist in
many articles of food, that their good wives sometimes put
a mineral of even deadly power into the bread which they
eat, and that they daily use as a condiment one of these
same luckless minerals. They speak of ‘mineral doctors’
as the poisoners of the race, while they claim so perfect a
safety in the use of their <em>vegetable</em> remedies, that no carelessness
or want of skill can make them produce any bad
results.</p>

<p>There seems to be a quite a general impression abroad
in the community, that there is a <em>harmlessness</em> in vegetable
remedies that does not attach to mineral medicines, and that
their effects are of a <em>less abiding</em> character. Nothing can
be more untrue. Let us look for a moment at these two
points.</p>

<p>First, as to the supposed harmlessness of vegetable
medicines. The most active mineral medicines are arsenic
and corrosive sublimate. But arsenic taken in large
quantity never produces death in a shorter time than five
to ten hours, and a large dose of corrosive sublimate destroys
life ordinarily in from twenty-four to thirty-six hours.
But among vegetable substances, oxalic acid, found in the
common wood sorrel, has destroyed life in ten minutes, and
prussic acid, which is the bitter principle in wild cherry,
bitter almonds, peach blossoms, &amp;c., in the dose only of a
few drops, destroys life instantly. Comparisons might be
made still further, showing that the most deadly and expeditious
poisons are vegetable.</p>

<p>Let us look now at the comparative <em>duration</em> of the results
of vegetable and mineral medicines.</p>

<p>Much is said, especially by Thompsonians, about calomel’s
staying in the system, and all the bodily ills of a life-time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
are often attributed to this cause without any hesitation.
Whether these wise ones have ever applied their rude
chemistry to the detection of calomel in such cases I have
not learned. But there it is, <em>for they say so</em>. It is in the
very bones! Though no intelligent persons believe in such
nonsense as this, yet the general notion that the effects of
mineral, in comparison with vegetable agents, are peculiarly
abiding, is not confined to the ignorant and unthinking.</p>

<p>Leaving out of view the direct corrosive effects upon the
living texture of the concentrated acids, I may remark of
poisons, whether mineral or vegetable, that they produce
either morbid <em>impressions</em> upon the system through the
nerves with which they come in contact, or local <em>irritations</em>,
which may result in inflammation. These impressions
or irritations may abide, or they may be partially or wholly
removed. The fact that they are produced by a mineral
is no more apt to make them abide, than the fact that they
are produced by a vegetable. We should expect this to be
true, and experience has shown that it is. For example the
irritation produced by elaterium (wild cucumber) or croton
oil, or any vegetable cathartic of a drastic nature, is as
lasting as if it had been caused by any mineral poison.</p>

<p>I trust that it is obvious to the reader from the above
statements, that they commit a great error, who suppose
that the fact, that a remedy is composed entirely of vegetable
substances, is a sure proof that it is innocuous, and
that it can be used freely without any discrimination. And
yet it is a very prevalent error, to which many lives are
constantly sacrificed, to say nothing of the multitudes of
cases, in which, though death does not occur, injury is inflicted
in various degrees upon the system. A single
example will suffice. A case is detailed in the Boston
Medical Magazine of a female, who had a medicine administered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
by a botanic empiric, which was composed in
part of elaterium. Her life was destroyed in thirty-six hours
by this <em>vegetable</em> remedy given her by this denouncer of
‘mineral poisons’ and ‘mineral doctors!’</p>

<p>Lobelia, it is claimed by the Thompsonians, is not a poison.
I have often heard them say that there was no danger from
it, taken at any time and in any quantity. Some have so
said under oath. The vulgar name by which this article
has always been known, Indian Tobacco, given to it from
the similarity of its effects to those of common tobacco,
show what its character is by general acknowledgment.
Thompsonians however assert that it is not a narcotic;
but every physician, who has had Thompsonian
quacks in his neighborhood has occasionally witnessed
effects ordinarily considered narcotic, produced by this
remedy. These effects, it is proper to remark, do not
commonly appear to any great amount, because vomiting
occurs so soon, and the medicine is thrown off with the
contents of the stomach. But when an ineffectual retching
occurs instead of free vomiting, and dose after dose is
given, narcosis is certain to supervene in a considerable
degree, and sometimes it proves fatal. This is especially
apt to take place, when the system from any cause is already
in a very depressed state. Several trials have occurred of
Thompsonian practitioners charged with killing their
patients under such circumstances. Two cases are reported
in Guy’s Forensic Medicine, in which the accused
were found guilty by the jury, and the penalty of the law
was inflicted.</p>

<p>The idea of Thompsonians and of some others in regard
to poisons is this—that there are some medicines which
always do harm, and these are poisons; while there are
some other medicines which always do good, and these are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
not poisons. The medicines used by the ‘regulars’ Thompsonians
consider as belonging to the first class, especially
their <em>mineral</em> remedies; while the vegetable medicines,
which they use in their practice, they claim to be of the
latter class.</p>

<p>Let us look at the true meaning of the word poison.
Webster’s definition of it is a correct one. He says it is ‘a
substance, which, when taken into the stomach, mixed with
the blood, or applied to the skin or flesh, proves fatal or
deleterious.’</p>

<p>This definition has no reference to the time or the
quantity required to produce the effect. There is a wide
difference in both these respects between different poisons.
Some are slow, and some rapid in their operation. Some,
as for example opium, arsenic, and prussic acid, act as
poisons in small amounts; while comparatively large
quantities of such articles as lobelia, saltpetre, and salæratus,
are required to produce ‘deleterious,’ and especially ‘fatal’
effects; and yet lobelia, saltpetre and salæratus are as truly
poisons as are opium, arsenic and prussic acid.</p>

<p>It may be remarked also that this definition has reference
only to the <em>usual</em> effects of substances; and not to
any occasional effects which may be owing to circumstances.
If, for example, any substance produce a bad effect simply
from the influence of any constitutional peculiarity, or some
temporary condition of the system, it is not to be called a
poison. The term poison is used often in relation to the
effects of substances in such cases, but it is only in a <em>relative</em>
sense. Anything may be a poison in this sense. Anything
which is inappropriate to any case will produce a
‘deleterious’ influence upon it, and is therefore a poison to
it. Food may thus be for the time being a poison to the
sick man, as really as a noxious drug. Indeed a noxious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
drug may be to him a cure, while in the same quantity it
would be perhaps even a fatal poison to him if he were
well. Thus a man sick with spasmodic colic is relieved by
opium, which is a noxious drug to a well man; and perhaps,
in order to produce the relief, he requires as much as would
kill him if he were in a state of health.</p>

<p>The word poison carries terror to most minds, and it has
therefore been one of the watchwords of Thompsonians and
other quacks, in their warfare upon the medical profession.
And yet, while they are raising this ridiculous outcry, they
themselves, as I have before said, daily use poisons, even
mineral poisons, as common articles of food. Salæratus,
cream of tartar, and even common salt,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> are poisons, for
when taken in large quantities, they prove ‘deleterious,’ in
some cases ‘fatal,’ and therefore come within the terms of
the definition.</p>

<p>I have said thus much of the popular prejudice on the
subject of poisons, and the use which Thompsonians and
other quacks have made of it, because there is so general a
misapprehension in regard to these points abroad in the
community.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude this chapter without noticing the
changes which have taken place in the sentiments and
practice of Thompsonians within the last few years. These
changes have been quite material. I have already alluded
to some of them.</p>

<p>Thompsonians formerly denied the necessity of education
in the practitioner. But now the candidates for
admission to Thompsonian practice must study, and must
submit to an examination before a board of Censors. And
though Thompsonians have from the first denounced the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
medical faculty, and their institutions, they have now a medical
faculty of their own, and have organized state societies.</p>

<p>Thompsonians are not now so bold and reckless in their
practice as they once were. In the infancy of this practice
every sick man, whatever might be his disease, or his
state at the time, was subjected to what was called “the
operation,”—that is, steaming and vomiting with lobelia.
But so many died during the “operation,” or immediately
after it, that Thompsonian doctors have learned to be more
cautious.</p>

<p>Cathartics used to be utterly discarded by Thompsonians,
but now they are quite extensively used. Indeed they
have widened their range of remedies generally. Once
lobelia and steam and red pepper were nearly all in all.
But now they are making out a very considerable materia
medica. At the same time they are dropping the names
Thompsonian Physician and Thompsonian Practice, and
adopting instead of them Botanic Physician and Botanic
Practice.</p>

<p>Once no Thompsonian doctor would practice vaccination,
because as he contended, it was better to have even
small pox, under the guidance of Thompsonian treatment,
than it was to run the risk of getting ‘humors’ from the
vaccine virus. But finding that their employers would
have their children vaccinated, even though they were
obliged to get the ‘mineral doctors’ to do it, some of them
have gone into the business themselves.</p>

<p>Such are some of the changes which have come over
Thompsonism, giving it a very different character from
that which it exhibited when it first came in its stern simplicity
from the rude hand of its founder. Its popularity is
already declining, and it will probably soon pass away, to
give place to some other kindred delusion.</p>

<p>Samuel Hahneman, the founder of the system of practice
called by this name, was born at Messein in Saxony in
the year 1755. At the age of twenty he went to Leipsic, to
obtain his education, with but twenty ducats in his pocket.
While he was going through with his course of education,
he supported himself chiefly by translating English works
on medicine. He professed to be dissatisfied with the
common modes of medical practice, and after he took his
degree, instead of becoming at once a practitioner of medicine,
he preferred to gain his livelihood by translating
books, and by contributing to various scientific journals in
Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>It was in the year 1790 that he first broached the idea,
which is the great principle of the Homœopathic system,
and which he soon dreamed was to overturn and dispossess
all other medical practice. He viewed himself as a
great reformer, as the founder of a system, and he was
soon ready to proclaim to the world, that his was the ‘great
gift of God to man.’ Discarding all the past experience of
ages as useless, with his mind filled with bright visions of
his future greatness, he was ready to say with Paracelsus,
‘the monarchy of physic is mine.’ In 1796 he published
his first paper on the subject of Homœopathy, in 1805 his
first work, in 1810 his famous Organon, and the next year
his Materia Medica. He died in Paris at an advanced age,
only a few years since, having lived to see his system
adopted very extensively all over Europe.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to spread before the reader the
principles of his system in his own language. There is in
his statement of them considerable verbiage, which has
quite a learned air, but which would be unintelligible to
the common reader. The essential principles of his system
are but two in number, when the mass of words comes
to be sifted by a little plain common sense.</p>

<p>The great principle, which lies at the foundation of this
system, and which has given it its name, is found in the
Latin aphorism, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Similia similibus curantur</i>. This is in
homely English, Like things are cured by like. In other
words, a disease is cured by remedies which produce upon
a healthy person symptoms similar to those presented by
that disease. Thus vomiting is to be cured by a nauseant,
diarrhœa by a laxative, &amp;c. Hahneman does not pretend
that this is a newly-discovered principle, but says that it
has been acted upon from time immemorial. Of this fact
the following examples are given. Senna has been used for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
colic; rhubarb for diarrhœa; thorn apple for insanity; the
sweating sickness has been treated by sudorifics, frozen
limbs by rubbing in snow, and burns by putting them to
the fire and by stimulating ointments. So Shakspeare
alludes to the same fact;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tut, man! one fire burns out another’s burning,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One pain is lessened by another’s anguish;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn giddy and be holp by backward turning;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One desperate grief cures with another’s languish;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Take thou some new infection to thine eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the rank poison of the old will die.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So also the common proverb ‘cure your bite with the
hair of the same dog’ has reference to the same principle.</p>

<p>All that Hahneman claims is, that he has taken this principle,
thus occasionally recognized, and demonstrated its
applicability to the whole range of disease, and made it the
basis of a system of practice.</p>

<p>Hahneman says that there can be but three relations of
remedies to diseases—heterogeneity, opposition, and resemblance;
hence severally, the Allopathic, Antipathic, and
Homœopathic systems of practice.</p>

<p>The Allopathic mode—that which treats diseases by creating
another disease—he says, “cannot cure in any case;
having no analogy, or opposing force to the symptoms of
the disease, it can never reach the parts affected: it may
suspend the symptoms for a time by heterogeneous suffering,
but it cannot destroy them.”</p>

<p>“Antipathic treatment is merely palliative. When the
action produced by the remedy employed, and which may
seem to effect a neutralization of the symptoms, or even a
cure, ceases, the reverse process immediately takes place—not
only shall the primitive malady return, but come it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
with aggravated symptoms, and in proportion to the doses
administered.”</p>

<p>“The Homœopathic is the only one which experience
proves to be always salutary. The pure and specific effects
of the remedies employed being perfectly analogous to the
natural symptoms, they go right to the parts affected; and
as two similar diseases cannot exist at the same time in the
same system, the natural symptoms give way, provided the
artificial ones slightly surpass them in intensity.”</p>

<p>The allopathic mode, he claims, is the mode of treating
disease in common vogue, and his followers call physicians
generally by the name of allopaths. Now we have no objection
to the name which they assume to themselves, but
we do object to their giving inappropriate names to their
neighbors. The title of Allopath, thus impudently bestowed
upon us by Homœopathists, is not a correct title. The
treatment of disease by physicians of the old school, as
they are termed, is not characterized by any predominance
of the allopathic principle. They do not ordinarily attempt
to cure a disease by creating another. They do
sometimes indeed make use of this principle. As good an
example of it as can be given is to be found in the
application of a blister to relieve internal inflammation.
Here a new disease is produced, upon a part which is able
to bear it without injury, in order to cure the disease in
the internal organ. And no fact is better established, as
my readers will all allow, than that disease is sometimes
thus cured, although Hahneman says “<em>Allopathic</em> treatment
cannot cure in any case.”</p>

<p>What Hahneman terms the antipathic mode is much
used by physicians. I mention as an example the treatment
of spasmodic colic by opium. This antipathic remedy
in almost all cases cures this malady, though Hahneman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
says the “antipathic treatment is merely palliative” and
never cures.</p>

<p>In regard to many of the remedies which cure disease, it
may be said, that we know not in what manner they do it.
As an example I will refer to cinchona, and quinine, the
essential principle of cinchona, in curing intermittent fever.
The fact that they will cure it in most cases is as well established
as any fact in medicine, but <em>how</em> they do it no one
knows. Many explanations have been ventured, but they
are mere conjectures. Hahneman asserts, that cinchona
and quinine cure intermittent fever on the homœopathic
principle, because, as he declares, he has found, that these
articles produce on persons in health symptoms similar to
those of this disease. His experience, however, does not
correspond with that of others, who are more competent to
observe correctly, than one who looks at everything through
the distorting medium of a favorite theory. Cinchona and
quinine have been given to many persons in health, both in
large and in small doses, in order to test the truth of Hahneman’s
alleged experience, and no such results as he describes
have followed. They seem to be singularly confined
to Homœopathists.</p>

<p>We see occasionally, but <em>only occasionally</em>, effects from
agents in the treatment of disease which seem to have their
explanation in the principle, that one disease is cured by
temporarily creating another similar to it. Hahneman fixed
his eye upon these few facts, his mind became filled with
the <em>one idea</em> which he there saw, and he was soon blind to
everything else. Losing thus his mental equilibrium, he
became an errorist precisely in the same way that thousands
have done before him.</p>

<p>The second great principle of Homœopathy is, that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
peculiar power, a ‘dynamic power,’<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> as Hahneman calls it,
is communicated to medicinal substances by minute division,
with agitation and trituration. This Hahneman considers
as his grand discovery. This was wholly an original
idea with him, and if it be a really discovered <em>fact</em> that a
peculiar power is thus given to medicines, the credit belongs
to him, and to him alone.</p>

<p>The minuteness of the subdivision prescribed by Hahneman
is extreme. He does not talk of doses so large as the
millionth part of a grain—this would be horribly disastrous.
A hundred millionth of a grain is quite a formidable dose.
A decillionth is the common dose, and this numeral is expressed,
after the old method of enumeration, by an unit
with a string of <em>sixty</em> cyphers. If we suppose the population
of the earth to amount to a thousand millions, a grain,
if taken in the dose of a decillionth of a grain, would supply
every inhabitant of the earth with a septillion of doses.
And if each one should take three decillionths of a grain a
day, the present inhabitants of the earth would require
very nearly a sextillion of years to use up the whole
grain.</p>

<p>A Dr. Dufresne reports a case in the Bibliotheque Homœopathique,
in which he unfortunately administered an over
dose, the <em>one hundred millionth</em> of a grain of strychnine, a
medicine which physicians ordinarily give in the dose of a
fifteenth or tenth part of a grain. It was a case of neuralgia.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
He does not say at what time he gave this over dose
of a hundred millionth of a grain. But after taking it he
says, “the patient was seized with a paroxysm of the neuralgia
in the night about an hour earlier than the regular period
of its attack. The usual symptoms were experienced,
but it was remarkable that they occurred in an inverse
order, attacking those parts last that were attacked first before.
<em>The dose was much too strong.</em> Madame B. was
like a mad woman all night; the racking pains seized her
whole head, and her face was swollen and burning hot.”
But it seems that after all, this over dose cured Madame
B., for “there was but one slight accession of the complaint
afterwards: the lady has ever since been perfectly
well.” Dr. Dufresne adds that he should never again be
guilty of such over-dosing, but that had he to treat Madame
B’s. malady over again, he should give a decillionth of a
drop of the alcoholic tincture.</p>

<p>Hahneman and his followers do not talk of these exceedingly
small doses in regard to powerful medicines only, but
also in regard to medicines considered almost inert. Nothing
is more common with Homœopathists than to give a
decillionth or two of a grain of charcoal or oystershell, or
common salt.</p>

<p>Hahneman thought much of the amount of agitation and
trituration, which were employed in preparing medicines.
He gives very particular directions as to the exact number
of minutes to be consumed by different portions of these
processes. In mixing one grain of any substance with a
hundred grains of sugar of milk, he directs that the mixture
shall be made thus—the grain of substance is to be added
first to a third part of the sugar of milk and they are to be
rubbed together six minutes—the mass is then to be scraped
from the pestle and mortar, which is to take four minutes—now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
it is to be rubbed again six minutes—then scraped into
a heap, which is to take four minutes—the second third of
the sugar of milk is now added—rubbing six minutes follows—scraping
together four minutes—rubbing six minutes
again—another scraping together four minutes is followed
by the addition of the last third of the sugar of milk—then
there is rubbing six minutes, scraping together four minutes,
and six minutes more of rubbing completes the mixture.
But this is only the beginning of the preparation which is
required. A long course of processes is directed to carry
the medicine to its proper state of dilution, up to the billionth,
trillionth, quadrillionth, even the decillionth, degree. For a
more full statement of Hahneman’s directions, I refer the
reader to Dr. Holmes’ Lecture on Homœopathy.</p>

<p>Hahneman is very particular as to the number of shakes
to which medicines in solution should be subjected. On
this point he says, “A long experience and multiplied observations
upon the sick lead me within the last few years to
prefer giving only two shakes to medicinal liquids, whereas
I formerly used to give ten.” What particular effect this
difference in the amount of shaking has upon the ‘dynamic
power’ of the medicines, he does not see fit to say. I
suppose he means that the more shakes a medicine receives,
the greater is its power. If this be true, what a tremendous
‘dynamic power’ must be imparted to some of the liquid
medicines in the saddle bags of country doctors, as they jog
about from place to place; and yet, poor unobserving mortals,
they never discern any of the effects of this power
though they might be very apparent to the acute vision of
Hahneman and his followers.</p>

<p>The common idea on this subject is, that when any substance,
as tartar emetic, for example, is <em>fully</em> dissolved in
water, no amount of shaking can effect a more intimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
union between the tartar emetic and the water. Nor can
it alter the nature of the union, so as to give the solution
any new power, or any increase of power. In order to alter
the nature of the union, you must introduce a third agent,
which shall act <em>chemically</em> upon the tartar emetic and the
water.</p>

<p>This is true so far as we know; and it was universally
acknowledged to be true till Hahneman came out with an
opposite opinion. But to establish what is so opposite to
all past experience, and to overthrow what has been considered
by all as an established fact, the very best of proof
is necessary. Hahneman says, that the proof is to be found
in the effects of the solutions, to which agitation has communicated
the ‘dynamic power.’ And if the effects, which
he asserts that he and other Homœopathists have seen, are
really produced, then the proof I allow is competent.</p>

<p>Some loose analogies, which have hardly the shadow of
plausibility are much relied upon by Homœopathists in
advocating the efficacy of their medicines. In relation to
the ridicule which has been cast upon <em>the little doses</em>, Dr.
Hering says, “suppose <em>electricity</em> had at its first disclosure
been sneeringly called <em>the little tempest</em>, how ridiculous
might it have appeared to those persons who were incapable
of comprehending its minuteness or its might.” And the
minute division of matter, as, for example, in the making of
gold leaf and in the diffusion of odors, is often alluded to by
Homœopathists, as illustrating the power of the little doses.
When they will prove that a little electricity will produce
a greater effect than a large amount of it, that a decillionth
of a grain of gold will make a stronger leaf than a whole
grain with the same extent of surface, or that a decillionth of
a grain of musk can be made to give out a more powerful
odor than any ‘allopathic’ quantity of it: then I will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
only grant that the analogies are good ones, and that they
go to show that Homœopathy is probably true; but I will
also engage to prove, that a tack-hammer can give a
stronger blow than a sledge, that smallness is always the
emblem of might, that a man will be better nourished by
Homœopathic doses of food than by the usual allopathic
ones, and any other ridiculous thing of a kindred character.</p>

<p>Having thus noticed the two great principles of Hahneman’s
system, let us now see on what kind of observation
or experience these principles rest. If the experience be
satisfactory in its amount and character, then, however
opposed these principles are to the ideas and doctrines
current among physicians, we must admit them to be true.
It is to <em>facts</em> that I appeal—<em>numerous</em>, <em>well observed</em>, <em>well
attested</em>, <em>comparable</em> <em>facts</em>. Nothing else can settle this
question. If the decillionth of a grain of strychnine, or
mercury, or charcoal, or salt, or oystershell, does produce
palpable and measurable effects upon the human system,
lasting twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty days, and does thus
cure disease, as Homœopathists assert, let it be proved by
<em>facts</em>.</p>

<p>As an example of the character of the observations,
which are relied upon by Homœopathists to establish this
point, I will take Jahr’s Manual of Homœopathic Medicine
published in 1838. It was ‘translated from the German by
authority of the North American Academy of the Homœopathic
Healing Art.’ This book is high in favor with all
the Homœopathists in this country. It is a closely printed
octavo volume of six hundred pages. Four hundred pages
are occupied with descriptions of the effects of about two
hundred remedies, and the remaining two hundred pages
contain a Repertory, as it is called, in which the symptoms
are arranged alphabetically, with the remedies which produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
them opposite. The Repertory is of service in investigating
cases, and, if we understand it, it is to be used
in this way. A list is to be made of the symptoms presenting
in any case, and then the remedies appropriate to the
cure of these symptoms can be found opposite to them in
the Repertory.</p>

<p>The descriptions of the effects of remedies are exceedingly
minute and particular. I will give a few examples,
taken almost at random from the descriptions of a few
articles. ‘<em>Drawing</em> pain in <em>hollow</em> teeth, extending to the
eye-brows—cracked <em>upper</em> lip—stitches in <em>hollow</em> teeth,
<em>when biting</em>—pain and pungency in the <em>elbow</em>, which allows
one not to stretch or exert the arm—pungency in the knee
and bend of the knee—inflammation and swelling of one
<em>half</em> of the nose—torpor and stiffness of one <em>half</em> of the
tongue (which half?)—blood blisters on the <em>inside</em> of the
<em>upper</em> lip—loss of appetite chiefly for bread and tobacco-smoking—phlegm
is hawked out, chiefly in the morning—rending
and stinging in the <em>corns</em>—red itching spots on the
<em>shin-bone</em>—tightening pain in the <em>joint</em> of the elbow—blueish
spots on the <em>fore arm</em>—tremor of the hands, when
occupied with fine small work—tingling in the <em>points</em> of the
toes—tingling in the arms and <em>joints</em> of the fingers—perspiration
on the hands, and <em>between</em> the fingers—stitches in
the ankle <em>when stepping out</em> (not when stepping in)—a
voluptuous tickling on the <em>sole</em> of the foot, <em>after scratching
a little</em>, making a <em>man</em> (woman too?) almost mad—ulceration
of the <em>big</em> toe, with a pricking pain—after stooping
some time, sense of painful weight about the head, upon
resuming the erect posture—an itching, tickling sensation
at the <em>outer</em> edge of the <em>palm</em> of the <em>left</em> hand, which obliges
the person to scratch.’</p>

<p>With such minuteness of observation as this, the Materia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
Medica of Homœopathy must contain a <em>mass</em> of facts, <em>if
they really are facts</em>. They are claimed to be such, established
by numerous and careful observations. Let us see
how this is done. If an individual take an article, his condition
is watched for some length of time, according to the
duration of the effect of the article. This is various. The
effect of carbonate of lime (common chalk) lasts fifty days;
saltpetre, seven weeks; red pepper, twenty days; salt, fifty
days; &amp;c. If then common salt, for example, be the article,
all bodily conditions, all sensations, all mental states, &amp;c.,
occurring within fifty days, are to be set down as the effects
of that salt. A collection of many such histories of cases
is used in making up a complete description of the effects
of this article. And so of other articles. The four hundred
pages of descriptions of the effects of remedies in Jahr’s
Manual are, according to the statement of Hering in his
introduction to it, made up precisely in this way.</p>

<p>If all action in the human system were produced only by
what is applied to it from without, and if the system could
be so insulated that only one thing at a time should be permitted
to act upon it, in this case, and in this only, would
such kind of observation be available. But how is it?
<em>Numerous</em> agents are constantly acting upon the system—food
of various kinds—air, through the medium of the skin
and the lungs—variations of temperature—varying electrical
and other states—mental influences—processes
resulting from previous impressions—all these exert a constant
influence, modifying the effects of remedies almost
infinitely. Some allowance is indeed made or affected to
be made, by Homœopathists, for <em>some</em> of these influences;
but, after all, the remedy administered is considered as
overtopping them all—it has <em>supreme</em> possession of the
patient, by virtue, I suppose, of its <em>dynamic</em> power. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
symptoms that can be observed in him, whatever they may
be, are the effects of the medicine, and Hahneman considers
the various influences of which I have spoken as only
modifying these effects, and that to a limited degree.</p>

<p>Proceeding after the manner which I have described, it
is no wonder that Homœopathists make out such a wide
range of symptoms for each remedy. The symptoms said
to be produced by nux vomica, with all their various conditions,
amounted some time ago to about twelve hundred.
How many the recent researches of Homœopathists have
added to them I know not. Even chamomile, a simple
mild tonic, as it is universally considered by our good mothers,
has three full pages of symptoms ascribed to it, beginning
in this formidable way—“Rheumatic drawing,
tearing pain, with a disabling numbness in the parts affected,
most aggravated at night, frequently with continued
thirst, heat and redness of <em>one</em> cheek, and hot perspiration
on the head in the hair—vehement pains, almost insupportable,
leading to desperation, aggravated by every movement.
Pains mitigated by warm cataplasms—beating pains
as from occult suppuration—cracking in the joints, particularly
in the lower extremities.”</p>

<p>The <em>mental</em> effects of chamomile are thus given. “Hypochondriac
paroxysms of anxiety, as if the heart would
break—restlessness, with anxious groaning and tossing
about—irritable readiness to weep, with whining and howling,
frequently on account of <em>old</em> or imaginary offences—aversion
to music, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>If one who knew nothing about chamomile should read
over the three pages of the effects attributed to it, he would
be justified in supposing it to be a fit agent for inquisitorial
torture, instead of being the innocent thing which all nurses
and old women think it to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>The effects of sodii chloretum (common salt) occupy
four and a half pages. Its <em>mental</em> effects are thus described.
“Melancholic sadness, with searching for many unpleasant
things, much weeping, and increased by consolation—sorrowfulness
about futurity—anxiousness, also during a thunderstorm,
chiefly at night—indolence, aversion to talk, joylessness,
and disinclination to labor—hasty impatience and
irritability—easily frightened—hate of <em>former</em> offenders—fretfulness
and disposition to angry violence—inclination
to laugh—alternation of fretfulness and hilarity—great
weakness of memory and forgetfulness—thoughtlessness and
mental dissipation—misusing words in speaking and writing—inability
to reflect, and fatigue from mental exertion—awkwardness.”</p>

<p>The mental effects of sulphur are thus given. “Sadness
and dejection—melancholy, with doubts about his soul’s
welfare—great inclination to weep, frequently alternating
with laughing—inconsolableness, and reproaches of conscience
about every action—attacks of anxiety, in the evening—nocturnal
fear of spectres—fearfulness and liability
to be frightened—restlessness and hastiness—caprice, moroseness,
and ill humor—irritability and fretfulness—disinclination
to labor—great weakness of memory—diliria and
carphologia—mistaking one thing for another—philosophical
and religious reveries, and fixed ideas—insanity with imagination,
as if he were in possession of beautiful things and
in abundance of everything.”</p>

<p>The description of <em>all</em> the effects of sulphur occupies
<em>seven</em> pages, and if it be a true description, it certainly must
be a very terrible thing to take sulphur.</p>

<p>There is a great show of accurate discrimination on the
part of Homœopathists. Extreme niceness of observation
is claimed to be absolutely requisite for the successful practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
of Homœopathy. The distinctions which are made
in regard to symptoms are not only minute, but sometimes
laughably so.</p>

<p>Pain is divided into simple, rending, pressing, tightening,
rasping, rheumatic, stinging, jerking, periodical, contracting,
burning, boring, spasmodic, cutting, bruizing, cramping,
drawing, compressing, constringing, sore, disabling, squeezing,
&amp;c. Some of these distinctions our ‘allopathic’ mind
cannot comprehend. Perhaps the acuteness of a Homœopathic
mind may recognize the exact difference between
pressing, compressing, constringing and squeezing pains, but
I confess that I do not.</p>

<p>All these different kinds of pain are produced by different
agents, and different agents cure them. Not only so, but
the same pain requires different remedies, as it appears in
different parts. Thus while one remedy cures a pain in
your <em>whole</em> neck, quite another one cures the same pain in the
<em>nape</em> of the neck. Different remedies are required to relieve
the same pain in the shin, the heel, the ball of the foot, the
toes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I counted up in the Repertory, twenty-four kinds of toothache,
in addition to a great variety of other sensations in
the gums, the teeth and the roots of the teeth. Besides,
there are fifty-five conditions under which toothache appears,
resulting from different agents. Some of these are
a little singular. Thus Rhododendron is apt to produce
toothache in a thunderstorm, and therefore, according to
Homœopathic reasoning, is the appropriate remedy for toothache
which is particularly disposed to come on in a thunderstorm—a
disposition of toothache of which I never heard
before. The remedy for toothache which comes on when
riding in a vehicle is sepia—no remedy is mentioned for it
when it comes on when riding horseback, or going on foot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
Homœopathic researches have not extended as yet to these
points. Pulsatilla is the remedy for toothache in the <em>spring</em>,
but there is no remedy especially for it in summer, autumn,
and winter. Such gaps in Homœopathic experience ought
certainly to be filled up.</p>

<p>The varieties of toothache are rendered still more numerous
by the symptoms with which it is connected. I counted
eighteen of these. Among them are coldness of the
ears, twitching of the feet and fingers, and a necessity to
run about.</p>

<p>An aversion to different things is produced by different
remedies. Thus colchicum causes an aversion to pork—zinc
to veal and fish—selenium to salt food—hellebore to
sour crout—arnica to broth—assafœtida to beer—sabadilla
to wine<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>—belladonna to vegetables—sulphur to washing
one’s self—tartarized antimony to tobacco smoking—spigelia
to tobacco-snuffing, &amp;c. Nothing is mentioned as
causing an aversion to tobacco <em>chewing</em>. Some Homœopathists
had better extend the line of discovery in that
direction.</p>

<p>Jahr has some singular grouping of symptoms. Under
the effects of colchicum we have “mental exertion, touch,
bright light, smell of pork, and improper behavior of others,
exacerbates the case excessively.” In relation to the
pork, he does not say whether it is cooked or uncooked—there
is certainly a failure in the nicety of his discrimination
here.</p>

<p>These Homœopathists sometimes make wonderful discoveries.
In the notice of the effects of stramonium, I
find this. “Air passes out of the ears.” Does stramonium,
I would ask Mr. Jahr, or his translator, Mr. Hering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
set up the manufacture of air in the ears, or does it punch a
hole through the drum of the ear, and thus let the patient
blow air from his mouth through the ears? Our allopathic
mind cannot divine how air can come from the ears except
in one or the other of these two ways.</p>

<p>But enough of this. The reader, I trust, has had a sufficient
insight into Homœopathic observation, to see that it
proves nothing. If it proves what it professes to do, then
anything may be made to prove anything that may be
desired. We laugh at the folly of the fly on the coach,
that supposed itself to be the cause of all the dust made by
the prancing horses, and the whirling wheels; but the folly
of the fly is as nothing, compared with his, who considers
all symptoms, bodily and mental, for fifty days as resulting
from a few decillionths of a grain of sulphur, or salt, or
oystershell. And yet it is upon such ridiculous assumptions
as these, falsely called “observations,” that the system
of Homœopathy is based. The results of these observations,
we are informed in Dr. Hering’s introduction, “have,
through the zeal of the Homœopathists, already filled more
than <em>fifteen</em> octavo volumes.” The Materia Medica of
Hahneman himself fills six volumes. It is spoken of by
his followers as “a rich arsenal, from which Homœopathy
may arm itself against every known disease; it contains at
present nearly 80,000 combinations of symptoms, with the
corresponding substances which shall produce their counterparts;
and it goes on every day to be still farther enriched,
and to such an extent, as to leave it utterly impossible to
assign any limits to the future developments of Homœopathy.”
What a stupendous monument of human folly is
this confused mass of rubbish! It is no wonder that a man
who could invent such a system as Homœopathy is, should
at last place as a cap stone upon this monument the grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
discovery, which he says it cost him twelve years of research
to make, viz. that seven eighths of all chronic diseases
come from a <em>psoric</em> virus, of which psora (vulgarly called
itch) is only the simplest development!</p>

<p>But it is said that, laugh as we may at the ridiculousness
of Homœopathy, as a system, it is really successful in practice.
If we are to take the testimony of such observers as
Mr. Jahr, and his brother compilers of the fifteen octavo
volumes of “observations” to this point, I must beg leave to
demur. But the doctors who practice according to these
same fifteen octavo volumes, and the multitudes, especially
the <em>female</em> multitudes, who practice in their families with
their little boxes filled with little phials of little globules,
with a little pamphlet of directions, testify, that Homœopathy
is eminently successful. Such <em>was</em> the testimony also
in regard to the success of Perkins’ Tractors, Dr. Beddoes’
Gases, and St. John Long’s Liniment. That testimony
does not avail just now, and I suspect that some years
hence, when some other delusion shall succeed in supplanting
Homœopathy, the present testimony of Homœopathists
to its success will avail as little.</p>

<p>But it is true, I most cheerfully allow, that Homœopathy
is more successful than any <em>exclusive</em> system of practice,
which is characterized by <em>positive</em> medication. It is so,
simply because it leaves the curative power of nature to
act freely, undisturbed by any officious interference. It is
also true, that Homœopathy is more successful than any
<em>over dosing</em> practice of any kind. But it is <em>not</em> true that
it is anything like as successful as a cautious <em>eclectic</em> practice.
I mean by this a practice which selects its remedies
from every source where they are to be found, <em>governing
its choice by the actual effects ascertained by careful observation,
without regard to any theory or any exclusive system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
of doctrines</em>. This is the only proper mode of practice,
(if it can be called a <em>mode</em>,) and though it makes no
such loud pretensions as are made by the different exclusive
modes of practice, in their strife for popularity, it is pre-eminently
successful. I mean successful in curing disease. I
do not refer at all to success in obtaining the public favor—that
is quite another thing.</p>

<p>The success which Homœopathy has realized, in obtaining
its hold upon the community, results from several causes
which I will briefly notice.</p>

<p>1. Mental influence. This system of practice is especially
calculated to produce a great effect in this way. The
very idea, that there is a peculiar power imparted to the
little globules by their preparation, acts upon the imagination
of the patient. It gratifies too the love of mystery, so
common, and so ready to respond to the appeals which are
made to it. The minute examination of symptoms, of which
such display is made by Homœopathic physicians, adds to
this influence upon the mind, by its imposing air of deep
and patient research.</p>

<p>2. A strict regard to diet and regimen. This I need not
dwell upon.</p>

<p>3. The influence of the curative power of nature, the
efforts of which are not interfered with by Homœopathy.
This is the chief cause of all the cures which Homœopathy
claims to itself, as the undoubted results of its infinitesimal
doses. The two influences first named prepare the system
for the operation of this curative power.</p>

<p>4. A comparison between the results of Homœopathic
practice and those of the practice of over-dosing physicians.
Such a comparison will generally tell in favor of Homœopathy,
because the plan of giving no medicine and relying
upon a favorable mental influence and a strict regulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
of diet and regimen, is much better than storming a patient
with drugs, as one would a citadel with balls.</p>

<p>5. An occasional use of remedies in the ordinary doses.
This is practised more often than is commonly supposed,
and especially by those who have from mere pecuniary motives
left the ranks of the ‘Allopaths’ and adopted the Homœopathic
practice. They <em>know</em> that in acute diseases
especially, there is sometimes pressing need of something
more than the tiny doses, and they resort for the moment
to their old mode of practice. And it is easy to do this
secretly if they wish, for calomel, morphine, &amp;c. are not
very bulky medicines, and a good dose of them can easily
be put into a very few little globules. Many a Homœopathic
patient is thus saved from death by the ‘old practice,’
while Homœopathy gets all the credit of it.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Mr. Constantine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
Hering, in his introduction to Jahr’s Manual, complains
that some of his brethren are not strictly orthodox—that
they are guilty of the inconsistency of mixing the
practice of the old and of the new school together. This
complaint however comes with an ill grace from him, for I
once knew this prescriber of decillionths of a grain of such
inert things as salt and oystershell, direct for a patient a
nightly dose of half a teaspoonful of red pepper—a dose
quite large enough to suit an ‘Allopath’ or even a Thompsonian.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>6. The facility with which people are imposed upon in
their attempts to estimate the comparative merits of modes
of practice by their <em>results</em>, is another source of the popularity
of Homœopathy. Most persons, as I take occasion
to show in the chapter on Good and Bad Practice, have an
opportunity of witnessing but a <em>limited</em> range of facts in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
medical practice—altogether too limited to enable them to
arrive at any just conclusions. And then the flying reports
abroad in the community on this subject are exceedingly
vague, and are not to be relied upon. Yet these limited
observations, and these reports bruited about by the
loose tongue of Madame Rumor, are the boasted facts, by
which Homœopathy, like every other delusion, has gained
its popularity.</p>

<p>Such being the sources of the popularity of Homœopathy,
I do not wonder at all that it has acquired so extensive
favor with the public. Neither do I wonder that many
very sensible persons have been captivated with it; for the
evidence upon which they base their preference is so limited
and so loose, that it is calculated to mislead any who
rely upon it. And I would not reproach nor ridicule them
for this preference; but I would simply ask them to look
carefully at the nature of the evidence, on which the success
of Homœopathy is so confidently asserted. If they
will do this, they will find that the evidence is insufficient
and deceptive.</p>

<p>Before I leave this topic, I wish to present to the reader
a case somewhat parallel to that of Homœopathy, which
may serve to illustrate farther the way in which medical
delusions acquire their hold upon the public mind. A clergyman
in a small town in Germany, interpreting the passage
of Scripture, ‘the prayer of faith shall save the sick,’
as having a literal and an universal application, some years
ago went into the practice of medicine among the people
of his charge upon this idea. He gives no medicine, but
merely visits the sick and prays with them. All kinds of
disease, acute and chronic, are submitted to this treatment.
He tells those that apply to him, that there is no need of
doing so, if they will only themselves repent of their sins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
and lift up the prayer of faith. It is only in default of their
penitence and faith that his prayers are required. He
shows great shrewdness in pointing out the sins of the
vicious, to which he attributes their diseases. This adds
much to his reputation, and to the mental influence which
he exerts upon the sick. He is sincere in his views, and
takes no compensation for his services to the sick, which
he performs in connexion with his pastoral labors. His
success is so great, that no physician has been able to get
a living in the place where he resides, and invalids come to
him from all the country round, even to the distance of fifty
miles.</p>

<p>In this instance, there are some of the same elements of
success that exist in the case of Homœopathy. His mental
influence upon his patients is very decided. He leaves
the curative power of nature to act undisturbed. And
added to these sources of success may be mentioned, as
having a considerable influence, a reformation in the life of
some of those whose vices he faithfully points out to them.
So far as apparent results are concerned, it is quite as proper
to attribute a curative ‘dynamic power’ to the prayers
of this clergyman, as to the infinitesimal doses of Hahneman.</p>

<p>Homœopathists often boast of the inroads which their
system has made upon the ranks of the medical profession.
But it is an empty boast. If the Homœopathic physicians
in this country could be gathered together, it would be an
assemblage for the most part of very common men. No
superior order of talent would be found among them.
There would be none who are distinguished for true research;
none who have made any respectable additions to
the literature of medicine, or to its store of experience;
and none who have ever had any commanding influence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
There would be some indeed who are reputed among Homœopathists
to be great men; but none, who previous to
their conversion to Homœopathy, were considered great
by the medical profession. A large portion of that assemblage,
I am persuaded from what I have seen, would be
made up of men, who have no true faith in the so-called
science of Homœopathy, but have a strong faith in the deception
which can be practised by means of it upon the
community, and its consequent availability in a pecuniary
point of view. Those who have such a strange cast of
mind, as to dupe themselves into a belief of Homœopathic
doctrines, after a thorough and scientific examination of
them, I suspect would be in the minority.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Though Homœopathists commonly look down with
contempt upon Thompsonism, as being vulgar and unscientific,
there is really considerable resemblance between
Samuel Thompson and Samuel Hahneman. Let us look
at some of these points of resemblance.</p>

<p>Both have a theory on which their practice is based, and
nothing is deemed true that does not correspond with that
theory.</p>

<p>Both reject all former theories and observations as worthless.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
Their light is the true and only light. “The medical
world was in total darkness till I arose,” said Hahneman;
and so said Thompson.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>As Hahneman said, “the Allopathic method never really
cures—the Homœopathic method never fails to cure;” so
said Thompson, the “regulars” cure no one—my system
always cures curable cases.</p>

<p>Both claim that all who get well under their system are
cured by it, and give no credit to nature; and upon these
asserted cures they build the reputation of their systems.</p>

<p>Both began their career as arrant quacks. Samuel
Thompson sold his patent rights to practice after his theory;
and Samuel Hahneman sold his secret nostrum for the cure
and prevention of Scarlet Fever.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Both were exceedingly dogmatical and authoritative, and
both quarrelled with their followers who did not yield to all
their assumptions.</p>

<p>The followers of both have very generally imbibed the
spirit of the “venerated founders” of these systems, and are
very sure that they are right, and everybody else is wholly
wrong.</p>

<p>The followers of both look upon physicians as a body as
being wilfully blind to the truth, and unwilling to adopt anything
new, simply because it is new.</p>

<p>There are a few points in which those noted “reformers”
<em>differ</em>, which I will very briefly notice.</p>

<p>While Thompson was an illiterate man, Hahneman was
an educated man; and, if the making of many books is
a proof of learning, then he was a learned man. Thompson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
Materia Medica is but a single little book; but Hahneman’s
Materia Medica fills six large octavo volumes.</p>

<p>Thompson’s theory is rude, and has no air of learning.
Its philosophy knows nothing of the modern chemical nomenclature,
but reckons earth, air, water, and fire, as elements.
Hahneman’s theory, on the other hand, has a long
name of classic Greek derivation, is more finely spun, and
is learned in its guise.</p>

<p>Hahneman has obtained special favor with the refined
and learned and wealthy; while Thompson has been for
the most part the favorite with those of common minds
and limited information.</p>

<p>There is one particular in which the two systems differ
very widely. Though it cannot be said of Thompsonism,
that it has never cured anybody, for it may <em>chance</em> to
cure like anything else; yet, in its general influence upon
the medical practice of the community, it has been an unmitigated
evil. Its influence has been to give currency to
the over-dosing, which has been so popular, and so destructive
to health and life. But Homœopathy, on the contrary,
is doing a good work in helping to destroy the undue reliance
upon positive medication, of which I have spoken in
the chapter on Popular Errors, as being quite prevalent in
the medical profession, and exceedingly so in the community
at large. And when Homœopathy shall have passed
by, as pass it will, like other delusions before it, I believe it
will be seen, that Hahneman had a vocation to fill, of which
he never dreamed, and that he has unwittingly done more
good than harm to the permanent interests of medical
science.</p>



<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> It may be proper to state at the outset, that the author has himself
suffered no encroachments from Homœopathy, and so has no personal feelings
to gratify in attacking it. It has not seemed to find, for some reason,
a congenial soil among the hills and rocks of Norwich. Two Homœopathic
physicians, (one of them a man of good education, and with favorable
adventitious circumstances) have tried to get a foothold among us, but
have failed. The author has many friends and acquaintances who are
inclined to Homœopathy, some of whom have their little boxes of medicines,
and swallow globules, and administer them to others. He is, however,
on the best possible terms with them; and Homœopathy is, in his
intercourse with them, more a subject for agreeable pleasantry, than for
warm or even grave discussion.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> Dynamic is a word of Greek derivation, meaning simply powerful.
Hahneman’s ‘<em>dynamic</em> power’ then, learned as it sounds to vulgar ears, in
plain English, is powerful power. It reminds me of a patient, who in her
fondness for expletives always spoke of her weakness as a <em>debilitated</em> weakness.</p>

<p>Hahneman seems to have been fond of words derived from the Greek,
and those, too, of no Homœopathic size. Hence such words as Allopath,
Homœopath, Heterogeneity, Pharmaco-dynamics, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> The inconsistency of Homœopathists in using medicines in Allopathic
doses is sometimes of the most barefaced character. An instance of this
kind I lately met with in a New York paper. It seems that the Homœopathic
physicians in that city appointed a committee to draw up some directions,
to be given to the citizens for the prevention and treatment of
Cholera. The directions are all quite consistent till you come to the 12th
which reads thus: “If the diarrhœa should become profuse (with or without
pain, and vomiting,) the discharges being watery and whitish, and the
strength rapidly failing, take five drops of spirits of Camphor every half
hour until it is effectually stopped. Should these symptoms become very
severe, three drops of Camphor may be administered every five minutes.”
In this direction they make a complete leap from Homœopathy over to Allopathy.
In the first eleven directions they adhere most strictly to the
Hahnemanic <em>attenuations</em> and <em>triturations</em>. But these, you will observe,
respect those only who are threatened, or imagine themselves to be threatened,
with cholera. It is well enough to amuse such with the ‘third attenuation’
of Cuprum or Veratrum. But in the twelfth direction, which is
for those who are actually attacked with the disease, the attenuations and
triturations are forgotten; for it now gets to be a serious business, and the
tiny doses will not do. <em>Three drops of Spirits of Camphor every five
minutes!!!</em> If the patient should be dosed at this rate, for twenty-four
hours, he would take nearly <em>two ounces</em> of spirit of Camphor. The whole
Homœopathic committee could not use up this quantity in a twelvemonth
in all their <em>extensive</em> practice, if they should give it strictly on Hahnemanic
principles.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> In the Domestic Physician, intended as a guide for families who practice
Homœopathy, this same Dr. Hering, who has adorned the book with
an engraving of himself represented as learnedly poring over some work,
(I presume one of that same 15 octavo volumes,) thus discourses of physicians,
under the head of Effects of Mercury. “This is the universal elixir
of the quacks in all diseases—who, whilst they pretend to restore their patients
to health, destroy their constitution. They administer it as calomel
in powders, or dissolved as corrosive sublimate, or in pills—those abominable
blue pills.” And then, “that no one may be deceived, at least not those
for whom a physician prescribes,” he goes on to give the different Latin
names of these preparations of mercury, as they are written in the prescriptions
of physicians, or quacks, as he so modestly calls them: This is
a little impudent in one who prescribes as remedies, and in this very book,
two preparations of mercury, and one of them the most powerful of all,
corrosive sublimate, made more powerful too, according to his theory, by
the ‘dynamic power’ imparted to it by Homœopathic subdivision and trituration.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> It is proper to remark here, that some, who at first adopted Homœopathy
from mere pecuniary considerations, may afterwards have come to a
full belief in it. For if, previous to their adoption of this practice, they
were undiscriminating over-dosers, <em>as most of those physicians who have
turned Homœopathists once were</em>, they find themselves actually more successful
in the treatment of disease than they were before their conversion.
This is owing only to the discontinuance of their over-dosing, but they of
course refer it to the “dynamic power” of their globules.</p>

<p>What I have said of the general character of Homœopathic physicians
will probably provoke them to pour out upon me the vials of their wrath.
But as they will undoubtedly administer it in <em>Allopathic</em> doses, and will not
stop to give it a “dynamic power” by “dilution” and “attenuation,” I shall,
I think, be able to stand up against it.</p>

<span class="fs80">NATURAL BONE-SETTERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The setting of bones is wholly a mechanical operation;
and there cannot be a natural innate skill in this particular
kind of mechanics, any more than there can be in any other
kind. It would be as proper to say that a man is a natural
watch maker, steamboat builder, carpenter, &amp;c., as to say
that he is a natural bone-setter. A man may be born with
a taste for mechanics in general, but not with a taste for
any particular kind of mechanics. This innate mechanical
taste shows itself in various ways, as the child grows up into
the man; and it is governed altogether by circumstances, in
selecting the particular branches of mechanics, from which
it will seek its gratification.</p>

<p>Every one applies these plain principles almost instinctively
to every subject but the sciences of medicine and surgery.
An exception is made of these, not only by the ignorant,
but often also by the well-informed and the learned.
The healing art seems to be cast out of the common pale
of reason; and learning, as well as ignorance, often refuses
it the plainest and most established principles both of science
and of common sense. There has always been a
disposition to mysticism on this subject, and the idea of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
mysterious bestowment of natural gifts has been an error
of all ages, and, I may add, of all conditions in life.</p>

<p>I have said that bone-setting is a perfectly mechanical
operation. The bones of the body are united together on
simple mechanical principles by ligaments and muscles.
When a bone is put out of joint, it is generally done by the
action of the muscles, perhaps we may say that it always is
so, when there is dislocation alone without any fracture.
A man falls from a house—when he comes to the ground
he puts out his hand, and the wrist, or elbow, or shoulder,
is dislocated. If he were dead when he fell, no dislocation
would occur, though there might be fracture; for the muscles
would fix none of the bones upon any point of support,
so as to give the head of one bone a different direction from
the head of its neighboring bone. It is for the same reason
that a man, whose muscles are relaxed and powerless from
intoxication, is not apt to have his bones dislocated in a fall,
though they may be fractured.</p>

<p>After a bone is put out of joint, it is the muscles and
ligaments which hold it there. In order to replace it then,
the resistance of these muscles must be overcome by force
gradually and steadily applied, so that the head of the bone
which is thrown past the head of the other may be brought
opposite to its proper place. When brought to this point
it is to be pressed into its place, which is commonly very
easily done—sometimes the muscles themselves do it.</p>

<p>The requisites for skill in performing this operation are
very obvious. It is plain that the man who knows the most
about the relations of the parts, will best know how to
adjust those parts when they get out of place; just as one
who understands most thoroughly a machine is the best
fitted to repair it when it is out of order. And there is no
such thing as an innate instinctive knowledge of a machine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
made of bones, muscles, and ligaments, any more than there
is such a knowledge of a machine made of wood and iron.
In both cases the knowledge is <em>acquired</em> knowledge—acquired
by observation and study. In order that the knowledge
which one has, even of the most common machine,
shall be accurate and complete, he must be familiar with
the parts of it when separated, and then with their connection
as a whole. For the same reason, in order that the
surgeon may understand so compound a machine as a
human joint, he should become familiar with the several
bones and muscles, and ligaments, and tendons, of that joint
separately, and then with their connection as they make up
the whole machine.</p>

<p>And by familiarity with the machine as a whole, I do
not mean merely that the surgeon should be familiar with
the parts of the joint in their connection, as they are seen
when the skin is removed with the fat and the cellular
membrane. In order to perfect his knowledge of the joint
as a whole, he must be familiar with it as it appears covered
with the skin, and observe it in all its various attitudes and
motions. This is quite as important a part of the knowledge
of the joints, as that which is revealed by the dissecting
knife. For the surgeon in his practice has to do with them
in this covered state; and if he be familiar with them only
in their uncovered condition, he will often find himself
much puzzled, and may commit some unfortunate errors.
A musician, who had always played upon a piano with the
keys open to the eye, would hardly venture to play a tune
with the keys covered for the first time at a public concert;
but I apprehend that there is many a surgeon who makes
his first real study of a joint as a whole in its covered state,
when he is called upon to determine whether some part of
that joint is out of place. This external geography of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
joints, as it may be termed, is not sufficiently attended to,
nor is the importance of studying it properly urged upon
the students of medicine.</p>

<p>The above considerations, I trust, make it clear to the
reader, what are the kind and the extent of the knowledge
of the empirical bone-setter. I am not disposed to say that
he has no knowledge at all. He has power to observe,
though his means of observation are limited, and therefore
his knowledge is limited, and of consequence inaccurate.
He acquires all the knowledge which he has by observing
(and that is studying) the external geography of the joints
to which I have alluded. He may perhaps have an accurate
eye in such matters, or, as a phrenologist would express
it, he may have the organ of form well developed. If this
be true of him, in many cases of dislocation he will readily
see where the irregularity is. He will see an undue prominence
at one point and a consequent depression at another.
The knowledge thus acquired by the eye guides him
in his practice. He pulls the bones apart, and then applies
pressure in such a direction, as to force in the prominence,
and remove the depression. This is the sum and substance
of all that an uneducated bone-setter can know, and his
knowledge all comes from observation, and is not the result
of any mysterious gift.</p>

<p>It is folly to pretend that the empirical bone-setter cannot,
by the study of the internal structure of the joints, add
to his knowledge and skill thus acquired from observation
of their external forms. And yet he assumes, and a large
portion of the public believe it, that not only does his skill,
unlike skill in anything else in the wide world, need no
adding to it, but that it would be actually impaired by anything
like scientific study. That his <em>reputation</em> would be
impaired very seriously, if it were publicly known that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
in any measure acknowledged the necessity of study, is
certain; for his skill would then be stripped of the charm,
which is given to it by the idea of its being an innate power.
It is for this reason only that he adheres so pertinaciously
to this false and ridiculous notion.</p>

<p>I have thus far gone upon the supposition, that the natural
bone-setter learns all that he knows by his own observation
alone, without any assistance from others. This is
far from being true. He is indebted to physicians themselves
for some of his knowledge. For example, the fact
that extension and counter-extension<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> must be made to
enable us to put the dislocated bone into its place, is not a
fact that he discovered. Somebody, (we know not who,
but it was somebody,) discovered it a long time ago, and
the knowledge of it has descended in the medical profession
from time immemorial. It is in this channel that the knowledge
of it comes to the bone-setter. He might as well say
that it was an innate idea with him, that knives and forks
are the appropriate instruments to eat with, as that he was
born with the knowledge of the fact, that the expedient
which I have mentioned is necessary in setting dislocated
bones.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will be said that the idea of pulling the bones
apart is a very simple idea, and that almost anybody would
think of that. So was the invention of knives and forks a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
simple idea. But it was come at rather slowly. The transition
from the use of fingers and teeth, to that of knives
and forks in their present state of perfection, was not a
sudden one. Improvement, in this instance, as well as in
every other, had its <em>march</em>, step by step—it was not effected
by a leap. So it has been with improvements in the setting
of bones. It is probable that at first many a bone was
pushed and twisted about, and then left in its dislocated
state; but at length it was discovered, either by accident,
or by a scientific view of the subject, that this pushing and
twisting could be made to answer the purpose, by first overcoming
the resistance of the muscles by extension and
counter-extension. The man who first knew this fact was
a real discoverer. And further, as the first knives and forks
were made in a very bungling manner, so the setting of
bones was at first done awkwardly and unskillfully. The
bones were probably pulled in a jerking manner, till a second
discoverer found out the fact, that it was best to make
the extension very gradually and steadily.</p>

<p>Here then are two very material facts in regard to one
part of the operation of setting bones, which are furnished
to the natural bone-setter from the experience of those
who have gone before him; and I think no one can doubt
that he learns them in the same vulgar way that the educated
surgeon does. Though they were new facts once,
they are now familiar to every one who has seen a bone
set, or heard a description of the operation. And I would
give no bone-setter the credit of having been born with
these facts in his head, unless he had been shut up from the
world till he was strong enough to set a bone, and then, on
being brought forth had set a dislocated limb, making the extension
and counter-extension in the proper manner. This
would be the only positive proof that he did not learn these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
facts from some one else. Many familiar ideas, which we
suppose that we thought of ourselves, unaided by others, if
brought to such a test, would be found to have descended
to us from our predecessors.</p>

<p>Bone-setters have not so much confidence in their innate
skill, as to refuse to learn anything from physicians. I suspect
that they do not object to reading a surgical book, or
looking upon a skeleton, if they can do it without its being
known. I heard one once utter the scientific names of
bones and their parts, such as humerus, radius, trochanter,
astragalus, &amp;c. He must have got these words from some
of the educated surgeons, whom he professes to despise, or
from some book upon surgery. It is hardly to be supposed,
that he was born with them packed away, in his head, along
side of his skill, ready for use, though perhaps his admirers
and patrons may think so.</p>

<p>I have said that the knowledge of the ‘natural’ bone-setter
must be both limited and inaccurate. Hence, though
in those cases, in which the dislocation or fracture is so
plain as to be readily seen, he may perhaps get along without
any serious difficulty, he is exceedingly liable to make
mistakes in cases which require nice discrimination. His
mistakes may be arranged chiefly under four classes, which
I will notice separately.</p>

<p>First. A common error is supposing a fracture to be a
dislocation. Generally there is no difficulty in deciding
which of these accidents has taken place. In cases of fracture
a crepitus (or grating of the broken ends of the bone
upon each other) can be perceived on moving the limb in
different directions. But sometimes it is difficult to perceive
this, and it can only be done by executing some particular
motions. In such cases the uneducated bone-setter is very
liable to make a mistake and often does. I will relate but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
three out of many examples of this error which I have in
my possession.</p>

<p>The first case I take from Ticknor’s Medical Philosophy.
A young lad in the city of New York received an injury
of the elbow joint, which, under the most judicious surgical
treatment, terminated in permanent stiffness. The
parents of the lad took him soon after to a bone-setter who
had acquired considerable celebrity. He at once pronounced
the elbow to be out of joint, and attempted to set
it. After repeated attempts, he at length by an extreme
degree of violence, which was attended with excruciating
pain, succeeded in straightening the limb. The bone-setter
triumphed in the achievement, and the parents were delighted
with the result. But the force employed to reduce
the pretended dislocation did such violence to tendons, ligaments,
and nerves, that the child’s life was in jeopardy,
and was saved only by the timely amputation of the
arm.</p>

<p>The second case which I shall mention occurred in the
practice of Professor Hooker in New Haven. A man fell
from a canal bridge and fractured the neck of the scapula,
the bone which is commonly called the shoulder-blade.
There was depression of the arm similar to that which occurs
in common dislocation of the shoulder; but the crepitus
and other symptoms obviously distinguished the case
from simple dislocation. Professor H. dressed the shoulder
in such a way as to secure a perfect apposition of the two
surfaces of the fracture; and, if the man had continued
under his care, a complete union would undoubtedly have
taken place, and he would have had a good shoulder. But
at the end of a week Professor H. found the apparatus
removed and the arm simply supported in a sling. The patient
had been to see a natural bone-setter, who convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
him that the Professor had mistaken the case—that there
was no fracture, but a simple dislocation. He accordingly
‘set’ the shoulder. The patient was much easier than he
was with the confinement of Professor H.’s apparatus, and
he was gratified with the bone-setter’s assurance that the
shoulder would soon be well. He continued to have confidence
in the opinion of the bone-setter for about six weeks.
Then, as the shoulder was no better, he went again to Professor
H. It was now of course too late to remedy the
fracture, and the poor man has a crippled shoulder for life,
as the result of his foolish reliance upon the ‘natural’ skill
of a bone-setter.</p>

<p>The third case was related to me by Dr. Mercer, of New
London in this State. It was a case of oblique fracture of
the thigh. The evidence that it was a fracture was of the
most palpable character; and yet the most famous ‘natural’
bone-setter in this part of the country, who has imparted
his ‘gift’ to his descendants, and even to those who are connected
with them by marriage, stripped off the dressings of
Dr. M., pronounced the case a dislocation, and proceeded
to ‘set’ it. The patient supposed that all was right, for the
bone-setter was considered infallible. But many of the inhabitants
of New London well remember the poor old man
Bolton, who for so many years with his crooked thigh, which
was pronounced so confidently by the bone-setter to be ‘set,’
literally crawled about the streets.</p>

<p>Secondly. The uneducated bone-setter is very liable to
make a mistake in those cases in which, though there may
be much tumefaction and pain, and the motion of the joint
may be much impeded, there is neither dislocation nor fracture.
Of all the cases of injury of the joints a very large
proportion are of this character. There is simply a sprain
or a bruise, or both together. Such cases the bone-setter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
almost invariably treats as dislocations. I will not at present
dwell upon this class of cases, as I shall speak of them
more particularly in another connexion. I will only remark
here, that if the bone-setter does but little in such cases, no
real harm may be done; but he may use so much violence,
in reducing the supposed dislocation, as to inflict a serious
injury upon the joint.</p>

<p>Thirdly. Another class of mistakes, to which the uneducated
bone-setter is liable, have relation not to the
mechanical principles of bone setting, but to what may be
called the <em>medical</em> in distinction from the <em>surgical</em>, or operative
part of the treatment. The mere operator, however
skillful he may be, is not a finished surgeon. Very far from
it. In order to be able to do his <em>whole</em> duty to his patients,
the surgeon must in addition to his skill in operating, understand
well the principles of inflammation and irritation,
and must be in fact familiar with the whole range of disease.
The bone-setter is entirely destitute of any such
qualification for his department of surgery. He looks upon
every case as a mere mechanical matter, and operates upon
it without any regard to the state of the patient’s health, or
to any of the circumstances of the case. He therefore
operates upon many cases that ought not to be operated
upon, and does to them a serious injury, sometimes a fatal
one. In some cases he neglects to do what is necessary for
the relief of the patient, and prevents any one else from
doing it. It may be that inflammation needs to be guarded
against, or to be overcome. This he neglects to do; and
not only so, but perhaps, by the violence which he does to
the affected part, he aggravates, or creates inflammation.
The same may also be said of his neglecting the prevention
and cure of spasmodic affections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>I will cite but a few cases illustrative of the above remarks.</p>

<p>A man had a bad fracture of the wrist, which was taken
care of by a regular physician. After the fracture united,
the joint he said continued to be very weak, but it did not
prevent him from getting a livelihood by doing light work
in a factory. More than a year after the accident, the wrist
became quite sore. Rest and some appropriate applications
would probably have restored it to its usual condition in a
short time. But he was persuaded to show it to a famous
bone-setter, who lived a few miles distant. The bone-setter
said at once that it was not set right in the beginning, and
that it must be broken over again, in order to set it as it
should be done. The great violence he did to the joint produced
a severe inflammation. It was in this state that I
first saw it. Abscesses formed in consequence of the inflammation,
and the final result was that the arm was rendered
useless for life. If this man had been thus treated
by an educated surgeon, instead of an <em>infallible</em> bone-setter,
he could undoubtedly have recovered large damages for
such mal-practice.</p>

<p>The second case which I shall relate is that of a young
man who had a chronic disease of the shoulder, which came
on gradually, without any evidence that the joint had ever
received any injury. A bone-setter, whom he accidentally
met, assured him that he could remove the difficulty, and
give him a good arm. He told him that the bone of the
arm had ‘dropped down out of the socket,’ that there was
‘callus in the socket,’ and talked about ‘squeezing it out.’
This opinion he gave without any examination of the shoulder.
He did not even remove a thick overcoat which the
young man had on. He directed a liniment, which was to
be used for some time previous to the operation of setting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
the shoulder. After using the liniment for six weeks, he
went to the bone-setter’s residence to be operated upon.
Three stout assistants held the patient, while the bone-setter
<em>squeezed out the callus</em>, and set the joint. The pain produced
by this operation was so severe that the young man
fainted. The bone-setter, thinking that the joint was not
yet quite right, repeated the operation the next day. The
consequence of all this violence was an increase of the
inflammation. There was much soreness and pain, and at
length several abscesses appeared in succession, which discharged
abundantly, and the arm became exceedingly weak,
very limited in its motions, and much emaciated.</p>

<p>Cases of hip-disease, as it is commonly called, are often
supposed by bone-setters to be cases of dislocation, and
sometimes are unfortunately treated as such. I might relate
many instances of this kind, but I will detain the reader
with but one, which I take from Ticknor’s Medical Philosophy.
In this case “the complaint had existed for some
time and produced a great degree of emaciation of the
affected limb, which gave to the joints an unusual prominence;
and, as is common in this disease, the limb was in
a flexed position. This patient had been attended by a respectable
practitioner, who understood the disease, and who
had done all that the art can do in this much dreaded complaint.
But the natural bone-setter was sent for. He pronounced
<em>the hip, the knee, and the ankle dislocated</em>; and
straightway commenced furiously pulling at all these joints
to get them in place. The boy shrieked, and entreated him
to desist. The diseased parts being exceedingly tender and
painful on the slightest motion, the complaints of the boy
only made his tormentor the more confirmed in his opinion
and the more persevering in his efforts to ‘set the bones.’
He did persevere till the child repeatedly fainted; and being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
fearful that he had <em>cured the patient to death</em>, or killed him
outright, at length concluded his manipulations, by saying
that he had <em>got the bones all in their places</em>. The disease
was so aggravated by this cruelty, that in a few days the
child’s sufferings were at an end.”</p>

<p>The last case which I shall relate under this head, is a
case of tetanus or locked-jaw. The patient had his foot
crushed. He was for four days under the care of a regular
surgeon. During this time such a course was pursued
as was calculated to prevent the occurrence of tetanus, and
the patient was in a very promising condition. But the bone-setter
was sent for. He discontinued the remedies which
had been used, and simply dressed the foot with a salve,
which was of course of an <em>all-healing</em> character. The
foot soon became very offensive, and symptoms of locked-jaw
came on, and in a few days the patient died. The
bone-setter within twelve hours of his death assured him
that he would get well.</p>

<p>Fourthly. Uneducated bone-setters fail most signally in
their treatment of <em>fractures</em>. In the case of a <em>dislocation</em>,
when the bone is once put into joint it is generally done
with. The joints are so aptly and closely fitted, that the
reduced bone is not liable to slip out of joint again from
any slight cause. But in the case of a <em>fracture</em> on the
other hand, after the bones are put into place, some care
and skill are required to keep them so. The pressure which
is brought to bear upon different points of the limb is to be
skillfully regulated, and motion of the two parts of the
broken bone is to be carefully prevented, in order that they
may grow together without irregularity, and with as little
amount of callus as possible. The bone-setter for obvious
reasons, fails in these particulars, and there may, therefore,
be found among his patients a great many crooked and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
shortened limbs, with a large and irregular callus. One of
the most deformed limbs that I ever saw was an arm which
had been under the care of one of the most famous bone-setters
in the country. The case was a simple fracture of
the two bones of the fore-arm, about midway between the
wrist and the elbow. Any ordinary surgical care would
have secured to the patient a sound arm without any deformity.
But when she showed me her arm, after the bone-setter
had dismissed it from his care as <em>cured</em>, I found that
one bone had its two parts united at quite an angle, with a
large callus; and in the case of the other bone no union
at all had taken place, but the ends of the fracture could
be still made to rub upon each other by executing certain
motions of the arm. Such mal-practice as this, in the
case of a young woman, who is dependent upon her labor
for a livelihood, ought to be punished with exemplary damages.</p>

<p>The remarks which I have made refer to ordinary fractures
merely. But there are some cases of fracture which
require a peculiar and nice application of mechanical principles
in their treatment. In these the bone-setter generally
makes an utter failure. For example, there are some
fractures of the elbow-joint that require a particular position
of the arm, and a nice adjustment of the apparatus
applied to it; and, in order to prevent stiffness of the joint
it is necessary that the surgeon should, as soon as it will
answer, begin to execute the motions of the limb, gradually
extending their range, till the joint become entirely free.
Such cases under the care of a bone-setter have always
resulted, so far as my observation has extended, in permanent
stiffness of the joint.</p>

<p>In the remarks that I have made upon the mistakes of
uneducated bone-setters, I wish not to be understood to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
claim that educated surgeons never make any mistakes in
their treatment of fractured and dislocated limbs. They
are not infallible, and some of them, I am free to say, know
very little about bone-setting, and have very little skill in
it. There is a mechanical tact which is necessary to make
a physician a good bone-setter, and some are so destitute of
this tact, that they are not even able to extract a tooth decently
well. But I do claim, that educated medical men,
generally, do have vastly more skill in this department of
surgery, than the herd of uneducated bone-setters.</p>

<p>If the claims of natural bone-setters be just—if it be
true, as they say it is, that surgeons are constantly making
mistakes, which <em>their</em> innate skill is as constantly taxed to
correct, then we should expect, that in those parts of the
country, which are not blessed with bone-setters, there
would be cripples in abundance, the victims of educated
unskillfulness. But I have never heard that it is so. There
has been no complaint that it is. And I have not a doubt
that in the neighborhood of every natural bone-setter, there
can be found more deformed and crippled limbs, than can
be found in any similar neighborhood, where educated surgeons
are not so fortunate as to have infallible possessors
of the gift of bone-setting standing ready to correct their
errors.</p>

<p>If the bad cases which occur in the practice of natural
bone-setters could be found in the practice of regular physicians,
they would be frequently prosecuted for mal-practice,
and damages would be recovered of them by the sufferers.
But I doubt very much whether anything would
be gained by prosecuting a bone-setter for the grossest mal-practice.
People are generally more willing to make allowances
for the uneducated bone-setter, than for an educated
surgeon; though, at the same time, inconsistent as it may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
appear, they may claim that by virtue of a divine gift he
is infallible. One would suppose that cases resulting badly
would lead them to doubt his boasted infallibility. But no.
They infer that these cases were beyond the reach of the
highest skill in the world, and that it was impossible that
they should have come to any better result. They seem
to regard it almost as a sin to express the least doubt to the
contrary. With this state of feeling, existing to such an
extent as it does in some parts of the country, no jury could
be found sufficiently unprejudiced to inflict any just penalty
upon a bone-setter for mal-practice; though they would
inflict it to the full, if the same facts were proved to them
in regard to any educated surgeon.</p>

<p>The testimony of physicians in such cases would be very
apt to be disregarded, however rational and clear it might
be, unless it could be brought to confront the testimony of
the bone-setter himself. Whenever this is done, educated
skill always comes off victorious over quackery. Nothing
so exposes and demolishes quackery, as a well-directed examination
of the quack himself. It dispels from the minds
of the jury the false notion of a natural gift that needs no
teaching; a notion, which, so long as it remains in the
mind, effectually prevents any candid examination of the
facts. They are made to see by such a course, that the
joints of the body are constructed upon mechanical principles,
and that they are to be understood just like any other
machine; and the ignorance and consequent want of skill
of the bone-setter become even ridiculously palpable. Some
few years ago a physician in Springfield, Mass., was prosecuted
by a patient for mal-practice. The case had fallen
from his hands into those of a celebrated bone-setter, who
appeared as a witness at the trial. The physician was triumphantly
acquitted, and the exposed ignorance of the bone-setter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
had more influence with the jury, than all the display
of surgical knowledge on the part of the faculty, drawn
out by the learned counsel.</p>

<p>It now remains for me to show why it is that natural
bone-setters, in spite of all their ignorance and their mistakes,
acquire such a reputation for success, as they often
do. I deem it a very easy task to do this to the satisfaction
of any reasonable person.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to those cases in which the bone
is not dislocated, but the patient supposes, and the bone-setter
supposes, or, as is more often the case, <em>pretends</em>, that
there is a dislocation. These are the cases which are the
principal source of the bone-setter’s reputation. He pulls
upon the affected limb and performs various manœuvres
with it, and then thinks, or pretends, that he has ‘set’ the
bone. In time the limb of course in most instances gets
well, and thus in a case of mere sprain he gains the credit
of having performed a wonderful operation. Especially is
this so, when the patient has been first examined by a regular
physician. <em>Probably more than half of the reputed
cases of dislocation which come under the care of bone-setters
are nothing but sprains.</em></p>

<p>It is easy to see how the credulity of the patient can be
imposed upon in such cases. He supposes that there must
be something out of place, and is not satisfied with being
told that there is not. Rest, the principal remedy in such
a case, seems to him to be a very ineffectual remedy at
least, and he gets out of patience. His imagination, with
the aid of friends, and neighbors, at length conjures up before
him the idea of a limb forever crippled. The bone-setter
is now consulted, and he says, of course, that there
<em>is</em> something wrong. No bone-setter was ever known to
say otherwise under such circumstances. After executing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
certain manœuvres, he pronounces all now to be right. The
patient is now satisfied, although the limb improves no
faster than it did before, perhaps not so fast. He is satisfied,
because he feels now that <em>something has been done</em>. If
the surgeon who first saw the case had gone through with
the same pretended setting of the joint, the patient probably
would have been equally well satisfied. A surgeon of some
note once remarked, that he pulled nearly all the sprained
joints that came under his care and pretended to set something
right; ‘for,’ said he, ‘if I did not do this, such patients
would go to a bone-setter to have it done, and he would do
them some harm, which I am careful not to do.’</p>

<p>But it may be said, that in many cases the testimony of
the patients in regard to the setting of the bone is of the
most positive character, and even that decided relief is at
once experienced. That it is often imagined, I know. I
have seen many cases of this kind, in which there was the
most undoubted evidence that the relief was wholly imaginary.</p>

<p>As the deception of the bone-setter in such cases is so
common, and so successful, even with persons of shrewdness
and discernment, I will mention two cases in illustration.</p>

<p>A stout Irish girl had an inflammation of the ankle, which
had come on gradually. She in some way imbibed the
idea that the ankle was out of joint, though she did not remember
to have hurt it in any way. I told her that it was
not possible to put the ankle out of joint without knowing
when it was done. But she chose to send for the bone-setter.
He came and pretended to set the ankle, and she
declared that he relieved her at once. The inflammation
however was still there, and was gradually dissipated by
appropriate remedies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>A gentleman, esteemed to be very shrewd by all his friends,
received an injury of the first joint of his forefinger, which
resulted in inflammation. After commencing medical
treatment, he was persuaded to consult a bone-setter. He
returned with a poor idea of the knowledge of regular physicians,
because ‘<em>they could not even set a dislocated finger</em>,’
and loudly praised the skill of the bone-setter. He soon
found, however, that the finger was no better, and, openly
declaring that he had been deceived, submitted the finger
to proper treatment, which in a little time removed the
inflammation.</p>

<p>These two cases, taken from the two extremes of rank
and intelligence in society, are fair examples of the imposition
which is so frequently practised by the bone-setter upon
all classes of his patients.</p>

<p>In this connexion I will notice another class of cases
not so numerous, in which the bone-setter either imagines
or pretends there is fracture, when there is nothing but a
sprain, or an injury of the nerves of the limb, producing
inability of motion. Such cases, at least in old persons,
recover slowly. If the bone-setter puts on his splints, he
commits a great error, but it is an error that may not be
detected. The splints are taken off in due time, and the
limb has recovered through the influence of rest alone.</p>

<p>There is another small class of cases from which bone-setters
get much credit, and in which their bold practice, I
will candidly allow, sometimes really does good. In the
recovery of injured joints there sometimes form adhesions,
which seriously impair their power of motion. I have
said that the bone-setter operates on almost every case that
presents, and he takes hold of these cases with a strong
hand. He breaks up the adhesions, and sets the joint free.
A regular surgeon would hesitate to do it, from the fear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
inflicting an injury upon his patient greater than he would
suffer if the joint were to remain with its limited power of
motion. The bone-setter fearlessly runs this risk, for he
has no very delicate sense of responsibility to prevent him
from doing it; and if he does harm, he knows that a large
portion of the community have so high an idea of his ‘gift,’
that they will absolve him from all blame. He may do
great violence at times, and make some very bad cases; but
there is little said about these, while the cases in which he
has the good fortune to be successful are in everybody’s
mouth.</p>

<p>The bone-setter sometimes acquires considerable reputation
from some cases of stiff joints and contracted tendons,
which are benefitted by a persevering course of friction,
fomentation, &amp;c. Physicians often prescribe such a course
in such cases, but they do not, like the bone-setter, make
the applications themselves, nor perhaps see that they are
made. In the one case the course is faithfully pursued, and
in the other it is not. A gentleman who had a stiff knee
cured by a quack principally by friction, detailed the treatment
to a medical friend. ‘I often prescribe just such a
course for similar cases,’ said the physician. ‘Yes,’ replied
the gentleman, ‘but you do not take hold and rub yourself.
If I came to you with an aching tooth you would pull it,
and not tell me or my friends to do it.’ There was much
truth in this reply. Physicians often give directions of this
kind, but do not see that they are followed up by the patient.
I do not mean to say that they should do all the rubbing
themselves. But they should show others how it is
done, and then see that they do it. All the credit which
bone-setters get from neglect of duty on the part of physicians,
they have a perfect right to.</p>

<p>Another class of cases may properly be noticed here, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
which I will cite but two examples. A lady sprained her
ankle. Instead of the gradual recovery usual in such cases,
the joint continued for a long time to be excessively tender—she
could not bear to have it moved or touched without
the most extreme care. The celebrated Professor Smith,
of New Haven, on being called in to see the patient, recommended
that all this caution in moving and touching
the joint be discontinued, and that it at once be put to use.
The prescription seemed to the patient to be a cruel one;
but it was obeyed, and the recovery was rapid and perfect.
The extreme sensitiveness of the joint in such cases is
dependent upon two causes, the imagination and nervous
irritability—sometimes almost wholly upon the former. If
this case had chanced, like the one about to be mentioned,
to pass into the hands of a natural bone-setter, his rubbing
and other manœuvres would have accomplished the same
object, and a great cure would have been proclaimed.</p>

<p>The other case was that of a lady, who had been long
confined to her bed with a spinal disease. She supposed,
and her friends did also, that it was not possible for her to
move her back at all. A physician, to whom one of her
friends described the case, said that he had no doubt that
the disease had all been removed by the treatment which
had been pursued, and that the patient could move about,
and ought in some way to be made to do so. He saw that,
as in the case just related, the sensitiveness and inability of
motion were chiefly or wholly imaginary. And he predicted,
that if she should be put under the care of a bone-setter,
as her friends had contemplated, he would get her up
and rub her back with his medicated applications, and she
would be able to walk about in a very short time. She was
carried to the bone-setter, the prediction was verified, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
her father, a distinguished clergyman, gave the quack a
certificate of the wonderful cure.</p>

<p>I remark upon these two cases—that, while Dr. Smith
prescribed intelligently, the bone-setter only <em>chanced</em> to hit
right—that while the discrimination of Dr. S. saved him
from applying a similar treatment to cases to which it would
be inapplicable, the bone-setter does much, sometimes fatal,
harm to many cases by his lack of this discrimination,
(cases which somehow fail to be reported)—and lastly, that
while Dr. S. had no public testimony paid to the success of
his discriminating skill, the <em>lucky hit</em> of the quack has been
proclaimed, by the certificate of the clergyman, as the result
of pre-eminent skill, throughout the length and breadth
of the land.</p>

<p>There is still another class of cases to be noticed. Sometimes
the motions of a joint are impeded, while there is no
obvious deformity; and yet the case may be something
more than a mere sprain, and often turns out to be so,
when the subsidence of the swelling reveals the true nature
of the case. It is a sub-luxation. That is, the bone
is <em>partially</em> thrown out of place, but is not fairly out of
joint. In such cases merely pulling upon the joint is commonly
enough to set it. As soon as the bones are sufficiently
separated to allow of it, the dislocated one slips into
its place, or rather is drawn into it by the muscles. I have
no doubt that many such cases, pronounced by physicians
to be sprains, are remedied by the bone-setter, not from any
superior skill on his part, but from the fact that he makes it
a practice to pull the joint in every case.</p>

<p>One great source of the reputation of bone-setters is to
be found in the flaming reports of their cases, made by themselves
and their friends, <em>most of which are either partly or
wholly false</em>. These reports are got up precisely in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
same way that the reports of the great cures of other quacks
are, and they have the same influence.</p>

<p>I will give two cases in illustration. These cases appeared
in a letter in a newspaper correspondence, in which
a self-styled reformer of some note undertakes to abuse the
regular clergy, and regular doctors, and laud Thompsonism,
and natural bone-setting.</p>

<p>One of these cases is that of a boy who was born with
a club foot. He states in regard to him, that, after the best
surgical skill of Philadelphia and New York had been tried
upon him in vain, he was brought to the bone-setter, and
in the course of a few weeks the boy (then six years old),
was perfectly cured. This statement I know to be false.
The bone-setter, so far from curing the boy, did him no
good. And further, the deformity of the foot has since
been relieved, so far as it can be, by the skill of one of those
regular surgeons, of whom the bone-setter so modestly said
to our wise reformer, “that during a constant practice of
more than thirty years he has scarcely found one who understood
his business,” while he himself had “not in a single
instance,” among all his cases, committed any error.</p>

<p>The other case was that of a man of whom it is said
that he “was caught by one of his arms by the belt of the
picker, and carried over the drum [shaft?] upwards of one
hundred times.” The bone-setter “found that his shoulders,
ribs and breast, were all badly lacerated—his left arm
broken near the shoulder—his right arm broken in three
places between the shoulder and elbow, much hemorrhage
having taken place—his right knee broken in pieces, and
partially dislocated—two of the bones of the toes of his
right foot loose in his stockings—a compound fracture of
the left leg—one of the condyles of the pelvis, near the
back knocked off—his skull fractured above his left eye—his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
scalp cut to the skull, and rolled up some distance—and
his whole body covered with bruises and lacerations.” It
is also stated that “the physicians who were summoned,
said he could not live an hour, and declined attempting to
relieve him.” Perhaps they would have taken this view of
the case if the facts had been as our reporter has stated
them. But they were not. <em>Nearly all</em> of this statement
is false. That the man was carried over that shaft “upwards
of one hundred times,” none but a stark-mad reformer
is foolish enough to believe—the man’s shoulders, ribs and
breast were <em>not</em> “badly lacerated”—his right arm was <em>not</em>
“broken in three places,” but only in one, and that not
badly—there was <em>not</em> “much hemorrhage,” but almost none—his
right knee was <em>not</em> “broken in pieces,” and was <em>not</em>
“partially dislocated,” but there was merely a small abrasion
of the knee-pan—there were <em>not</em> “two bones in his
stockings,” but one small piece of bone in one stocking—there
was <em>not</em> “a compound fracture of the left leg,” but a
simple one—“one of the <em>condyles</em> of the pelvis near the
back” was <em>not</em> “knocked off,” for there is no such thing in
the body, and besides, the man himself says that there was
no injury of the back, and so says his wife who took care
of him—his skull was <em>not</em> “fractured above the left eye,”
nor anywhere else—his scalp, instead of being “cut to the
skull and rolled up some distance,” was not enough injured
to leave any scar—“his whole body” was <em>not</em> “covered
with bruises and lacerations”—and finally, the physicians
did <em>not</em> say that “he could not live an hour,” for they saw
no <em>mortal</em> injury in three simple fractures. But not only
is this statement false in almost every particular, but there
are some facts in regard to this case which are omitted.
Under the care of the bone-setter the right arm united in
bad shape, though the fracture was simple and perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
manageable; and the leg, before it became firmly united,
was broken again by the bone-setter in an attempt to ‘stretch
down the cords,’ as he expressed it, and finally came under
the care of one of those regular ‘scientific’ physicians, of
whom our reformer says that “probably not one in a hundred
knows how to manage such cases.” If it had been
under his care from the beginning, the leg would undoubtedly
have healed in good shape, but now there is a large
irregular callus, which was produced by the violence done
to it by the ignorant bone-setter in ‘stretching down the
cords.’<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>No wonder that such a collector of facts as this reformer
has proved himself to be, should make the sweeping remark,
that “there is incomparably more of quackery in the schools
of law, physic, and divinity, than there is out of them.”
The other cases, which he gives in his letter, are probably
about as worthy of belief as the two which I have extracted.
And these two are a fair sample of the degree of truth in
the wonderful stories which are told in relation to the feats
of bone-setters.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>I flatter myself that I have made it clear to the reader,
that it is no difficult matter for the natural bone-setter, in
spite of his ignorance of the structure of the joints, and his
consequent mistakes in managing injuries of them, to acquire
a reputation for skill, especially if he have some mechanical
tact, a good share of shrewdness, a plausible way
of <em>embellishing</em> his narratives of cases, and impudence
withal. I have said that a very large proportion (probably
more than half) of his reputed cases of dislocations are
mere sprains. All these he gets the credit of setting, and
many of them after they have been seen by some physician.
Add to these his occasional lucky hits in breaking up old
adhesions, and in setting by his random pulling some sub-luxations,
and here is material enough, with a loose veracity,
to make up a reputation in this credulous and marvel-loving
world.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> Some of my readers will require an explanation of these terms. In a
case of fracture the broken ends often slip by each other. We draw therefore
upon the two portions to bring them into their proper position. The
traction exerted upon the portion the farthest from the body is called
extension, while that which is exerted upon the other portion is called
counter-extension. So when a bone is dislocated the force exerted in drawing
the head of it from its position is called extension, while the force by
which its fellow bone is drawn in the opposite direction is called counter-extension.</p>

<p>A physician of great eminence was once called to see a clergyman who
had sprained his wrist. The sprain was a bad one, and produced considerable
inflammation, and therefore gave him great pain. The treatment
which my friend pursued relieved the patient, and nothing was wanting
but rest to complete the cure. But he very imprudently and in direct disobedience
to his physician’s injunctions, drove a spirited horse on quite
a long ride with his lame wrist, and of course renewed in some degree the
soreness and inflammation. He now put himself under the care of a bone-setter,
and after his wrist got well, forgetting the <em>gratuitous</em> as well as
successful services of his physician, this clergyman gave the quack a laudatory
puff in one of the public papers.</p>

<span class="fs80">GOOD AND BAD PRACTICE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One would suppose at first thought, that the difference
between the results of good, and those of bad practice in
medicine, would be palpable to the most common and superficial
observation. But it is evidently not so. Facts in
great abundance show that it is far otherwise. The history
both of medicine, and of quackery, furnishes many instructive
lessons on this subject. If we confine our view to the
medical profession, we see often two directly opposite modes
of practice praised by their adherents, as being successful
in the same complaints. We see the profession and the
community both divided on this point, each party asserting
with zeal the claims of its favorite system of practice to
pre-eminence.</p>

<p>I will cite but a single example in illustration of these
remarks. Some years ago there was a warm discussion
carried on among quite a large portion of the medical profession
in New England, in regard to the general character
of diseases in this part of the country, and their proper
mode of treatment. One party, at the head of which was
Dr. Gallup, asserted that the diseases of New England had
been, since the beginning of the present century, almost
altogether sthenic or inflammatory, and therefore had required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
depleting remedies. Another party, whose chief
champions were Doctors Miner and Tully, contended that
diseases had been asthenic, or characterized by debility, instead
of an inflammatory tendency, and that they therefore
required stimulants. While Dr. Gallup denounced the
treatment of disease, pursued by the adherents of Drs.
Miner and Tully, as “incendiary treatment,” and lauded
bleeding as the chief remedy for the present time; Dr.
Tully, on the other hand, says that “the lancet is a weapon
which annually slays more than the sword,” and that “the
king of Great Britain, without doubt, loses every year more
subjects by these means”—depleting remedies—“than the
battle and campaign of Waterloo cost him, with all their
glories.”</p>

<p>Now if it were easy, by looking at results, to decide in
all cases what is good, and what is bad practice, it is evident
that such diametrically opposite modes of treatment
could not be in vogue at the same time. The proper distinctions
would be made, and the good practice would be
approved, both by the profession and by the public; while
that which was seen to be injurious in its results would at
once be rejected.</p>

<p>So also, if it were easy to make this distinction, the truly
skillful physician could always be recognized as such, while
the unskillful and ignorant practitioner would not be able,
as he now often is, to obtain from the public, in spite of his
deficiencies and his blunders, the meed of praise due to real
merit and actual success. The quack, too, would stand
forth in his true light, in contrast with the man of science
in the results of his practice, instead of claiming, with brazen
effrontery, and receiving from the multitude, as he
now often does, the credit of being even pre-eminently successful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>There never was such a variety of systems of quackery
before the community as there is at the present time. To
say nothing of minor claimants, there is Thompsonism,
almost parboiling its patients with steam, and shaking them
to shreds with lobelia, and burning them up with cayenne;
and Hydropathy, that wraps up its devotees in the cold, wet
blanket; and then gentle, sweet, refined, sublimated Homœopathy,
that starts with horror at the very idea of such
harsh means, and professes to neutralize all disease with
little else than the mere shadow of medicine. Each one of
these systems, so opposite to each other, asserts its claim to
be the only true system of medicine, and bases this claim
upon the success which attends it. The same claim is also
essentially made in behalf of numberless medicines which
are before the public.</p>

<p>Amid all these opposing claims many are bewildered, and
ever in doubt where the truth lies, are never established
upon anything, but fly from one thing to another, as the
evidence of success preponderates in favor of this, or that
medicine, or system. Others become the firm and enthusiastic
advocates of some one of them, but after a while discard
this for another, and few adhere to any one thing during
a whole life. And it is amusing to see with what ease
some make the transition from one mode of practice to
another, which is totally different from it, being quite sure
that they are right in doing so; and yet, if they are right,
the error from which they have escaped is a very great
one. They do not however always view it in this light, for
they sometimes recur to their former preferences, though
they are as inconsistent with their present ones as they well
could be. If Homœopathy be right, then Thompsonism
must be <em>very</em> wrong; and yet I have known persons, who
are disposed to quackery, go from one to the other, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
speak in praise of both as being successful modes of practice,
without seeming to be aware that they are so entirely
opposite to each other. So there are some, who at the same
time manifest confidence both in the common practice of
medicine, and in Homœopathy; though if Homœopathy
be right, almost the whole body of physicians are rank murderers,
and if physicians be right, Homœopathy is as ridiculous
an error as ever obtained a foothold in the community.
And then there are some, who appear in the space
of a twelvemonth, at different times, as the advocates of
Homœopathy, Thompsonism, Hydropathy, and perhaps
Chrono-thermalism, to say nothing of various patent medicines
from some College of Health, or some German physician,
with a long list of titles, or some Indian doctor laden
with remedies fresh from nature’s rudest and most secret
arcana.</p>

<p>Now it is clear, that if it were an easy thing to decide
what is successful practice and what is not, from an observation
of results, then there would not be such diversity,
nor such frequent change of opinion in the public mind, in
regard to modes of treatment so directly opposed to each
other, as those are which I have mentioned. The advocates
of them would not so boldly urge their claims, knowing
the facility with which these claims could be tested.
But the difficulties which actually lie in the way of testing
them are such, that the community are exceedingly liable
to be deceived. Practice, which is really unsuccessful, is
often made by its advocates to appear for a time at least, to
be more successful than any other mode of treatment, and
it is often only by long continued observation that this error
is corrected.</p>

<p>This error exists at this time among a large portion of
the community in relation to Homœopathy, and it is to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
removed by the same gradual process, by which all kindred
errors have been removed hitherto. By observation it will
be found by its advocates, one after another, that its reputation
for success is founded upon mistake, and it will thus
step by step lose its hold upon the public favor, to make
way for some other system, which in its turn must go through
with the same process.</p>

<p>Those who embrace some form of quackery from mercenary
views, are aware of the facility with which the multitude
are deceived in regard to the comparative results of
different modes of practice; and it is this which makes
them so confidently anticipate at least a temporary success.
Homœopathy furnishes many examples of this character.
While there are a few in the medical profession, of a
peculiar cast of mind, who are honest Homœopathists; there
are others, of various degrees of intellectual merit, who
have adopted this mode of practice, simply because they
have failed to acquire business in the ordinary way, or because
they saw in the adoption of a system, just now popular,
a fair prospect of so increasing business, as to secure
wealth instead of a mere competence; and others still, who
have dubbed themselves physicians, have gone into the
practice of Homœopathy, as mere adventurers, preferring
very wisely to try their luck on the tide of a popular error,
instead of trusting to knowledge and skill, of which they
have little or none. These two last classes of Homœopathic
physicians indulge the hope, that the community will
be deceived, in regard to the success of their system of
practice, a sufficient length of time to enable them to
realize their golden expectations; and then, when this false
system shall be supplanted by some other, they will be ready
to adopt that other for the same <em>solid</em> reasons for which
they have adopted this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>I need not dwell longer upon the proofs of the fact, that
the comparative success of different physicians, and different
modes of practice, is not easily discovered by the public,
nor even always by the scientific observer. Before I
proceed to show why such a difficulty exists in regard to
this point, it is best that the reader should understand distinctly
what I mean by good and bad practice.</p>

<p>I do not mean by good practice, the use of remedies which
are essentially good, that is, beneficial in all cases; nor by
bad practice, the use of remedies which are essentially bad,
that is, injurious in all cases. There are no such medicines.
Thompsonians claim that there are—that cayenne, lobelia,
&amp;c., are always beneficial, while calomel, opium. &amp;c., are
always deleterious. And this view of the subject is not
confined to Thompsonians. There is a strong tendency to
this exclusive notion in regard to remedies and systems of
practice abroad in the community, and it is occasionally
witnessed even in members of the medical profession.</p>

<p>If it were true, that some one system of remedies and
doctrines is wholly good, while all others are bad, it would
be very easy for the community to decide between what is
good, and what is bad practice in medicine. It would only
have to watch, and whatever it saw uniformly doing harm
reject, and whatever it saw uniformly doing good retain.
But the subject is not thus simplified. There are some
good points in every system of practice. However bad it
may be on the whole, it will do some good in some cases.
For example, the Thompsonian system, though it is bad as
a system, inasmuch as it is injurious, often destructive in
its results as applied indiscriminately to all cases, yet sometimes
does good, and very often in the same case does at
one stage of it good, and at another harm. Thus an attack
of fever, especially if it depend upon a disordered stomach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
may be broken up by an emetic of lobelia. Though commonly
some other emetic would do it better, yet there is no
question that in such a case the lobelia ordinarily does well.
Now, after this is done, if the case were left to itself with
rest and a simple diet, the cure would soon be completed.
But the Thompsonian often undoes in part, and sometimes
wholly, the good which he has done. By his heating remedies
he induces a slight fever, with a morbid state of the
mucous membrane of the stomach, indicated by a bad
tongue, red, or furred, or both; and he thus makes a lingering
case of one which should have been a short one, and
perhaps creates slow disease, of which the patient may never
get rid by any treatment.</p>

<p>But I will take an example from the practice of physicians,
as well as from quackery. The stimulating practice,
of which some have been so fond as to apply it quite extensively
in the treatment of disease, furnishes a good illustration
of my remarks. As a system it is bad, just as a
system on the opposite extreme is bad. And yet either of
these systems is good in some cases, and often both are
applicable to the same case in different stages of it. The
truth is, that no <em>exclusive</em> system of practice can be said
to be a good system, for it is impossible that it should suit
all the varying states presented by disease.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>It is now sufficiently obvious to the reader, that I mean
by bad practice, simply that which is inappropriate to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
particular case under treatment. And it is also obvious to
him, that a correct decision upon this point, made from
observation of results, is arrived at with much more difficulty,
than it would be, if what is good in practice were
wholly and always good, and what is bad were wholly and
always bad.</p>

<p>I will now proceed to show what are the real points of
difference between the results of good, and those of bad
practice, and why it is that the community are so liable to
mistake in their attempts at comparing these results.</p>

<p>In the chapter on the Uncertainty of Medicine, I treated
quite at large of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix naturæ</i>, or the tendency
of the system to throw off disease, and thus cure itself.
<em>In the great majority of cases of sickness which fall under
the care of the physician, this recuperative power is competent
to effect a cure if they are left to themselves, and in
most of them it will do so, even though a positively bad treatment
may be pursued.</em> Let me not be understood to say
that the kind of treatment which these cases receive makes
no difference with them. It does make a great difference;
but this difference does not ordinarily have any direct and
present relation to the question of life and death, but it lies
in circumstances which may be subjects of dispute, viz., the
length of the sickness, the course which the symptoms take,
the injury inflicted upon this or that organ, or upon the
constitution, &amp;c. Of these points I shall soon speak more
particularly.</p>

<p>The cases, in which the difference in results between
good and bad practice is immediate and palpable, are then
few in comparison with the whole number of cases which
come under treatment. It is in these few cases only, that
it is of <em>present</em> vital importance to pursue exactly the right
course. And if the community could select these from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
whole mass of cases, separating them both from those which
are mild, and from those which were originally mild but have
been made severe by injudicious treatment, and then should
make these cases the basis of an estimate of the comparative
success of different modes of practice, it might arrive
at a just conclusion. The really skillful would like to be
put to such a test, in comparing him with the ignorant and
unskillful, whether they be in or out of the profession.
For it is in such cases that quackery and unskillfulness
most signally fail, and it is only by escaping this test that
they escape the disgrace and neglect which are their due.
At a future stage of my remarks, I shall point out the
insuperable difficulties, which are in the way of making the
selection of cases above alluded to, and forming an opinion
upon them.</p>

<p>Before leaving this point I would remark, that the failure,
of which I have just spoken, though not generally obvious
to the common observer, does sometimes at length open
the eyes of those, who have relied upon their own judgment
in medicine, or upon the plausible pretensions of
quackery. And unfortunately such persons commonly
have to regret that their eyes are opened too late. For
example, a family may go on for some time, even for years,
without asking for the services of a physician, and, though
they may have some sickness occasionally, they get along
apparently very well by their own domestic management,
with now and then the use of some patent medicine, or the
advice of some popular empiric. All the cases of disease,
which occur in this family during this period, are of such a
character, that nature herself could cure them unassisted,
or even when injudiciously meddled with. They all result,
therefore, in recovery, though an impaired constitution is
produced in some of the members of the family by this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
irregular and bungling management. At length, one of
them is taken sick with a disease of so grave a character,
and in such an amount, that a nicely-adjusted mode of
treatment affords the only chance for safety. Everything
now goes wrong, and, perhaps, after the case has become
desperate, a physician is called in. I know not what is more
trying to the feelings of a humane physician than such a
case as this. He sees before him a fellow-man, perhaps a
kind neighbor, or a valued friend, on the brink of the grave,
the victim of error. He cannot rebuke the family for the
course which they have pursued, for they have been honest
in it, and it would do no good now. It is too late, and it
would only add to the anguish which they suffer, in the
prospect of losing one so dear to them. He sees that for
a long time they have been drinking in quackery, and now
that they have come at last to the very dregs, they have
called him in to partake with them of its bitterness. There
is a struggle between his feelings and his sense of duty.
He would gladly have nothing to do with a case thus
thrown upon his hands in the hour of its extremity, but he
is bound to do all to save a fellow-being from death that
can be done, even to the last; and then he remembers that
recovery has sometimes taken place, when death seemed
inevitable. He therefore addresses himself to his task, but
it is in vain. The patient dies. An examination of the
body reveals to the physician, as clearly as anything can be
revealed, the fact, that the treatment which was pursued,
previous to his taking charge of the case, was inappropriate
and destructive.</p>

<p>This is no fancy sketch. Physicians are occasionally
obliged to witness such scenes. I have a vivid recollection
of one which occurred in a case of so interesting a character,
that I will briefly notice it. The patient was one, who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
with most of his family, had pursued such a course as the
one I have described. He had himself, taken Thompsonian
remedies for a long time, for what he supposed to be a ‘bilious
trouble.’ He at length was suddenly laid upon his bed
by a most violent attack. Though he had faith enough in
Homœopathy to take some medicine at the hands of a disciple
of that school that very morning, he put himself
under the care of a Thompsonian. In a few hours, being
satisfied that his favorite system was not working well now,
though he thought it had done so heretofore, he requested
that I should be sent for. As I expected from the aspect
of the case, though he gained some relief to his sufferings,
he died. On examination after death, we found extensive
chronic inflammation of the stomach and bowels, which had
evidently been accumulating for some time, and which at
length, by a sudden aggravation from some unknown cause,
produced the attack which destroyed his life.</p>

<p>In regard to this case it is clear, that if the course which
this patient pursued for weeks and months before the final
attack, was not adequate of itself to cause such an inflammation,
it at least was directly calculated to foster it when
it was once begun. And yet, because Thompsonism had
never absolutely killed any member of his family, he confided
in it most fully, though it was hurrying the disease within
him on to a fatal termination; and he let go of that confidence,
only when it was too late to retrieve his error. And
farther than this, the probability is, that if he had put himself
under the care of a judicious physician, when the
inflammation had but just begun, it might have been overcome,
for cases of recovery from this disease, when early
put under treatment, are not at all rare in medical experience.</p>

<p>In the case which I have related, the influence of bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
practice was palpable; but even here it was not so during
all the time it was doing its deadly work, but only after
that work was done. And in most cases in which bad
treatment has been ruinous in its results, the evidence is
not such, even at the conclusion of the case, as will satisfy
the public, at least that portion of it which is inclined to
quackery. An examination after death is not always obtained;
and when it is, it will not always afford us as clear
evidence, as was seen in the case above related, for both
disease and medicine may destroy life, without leaving any
manifest and undisputed traces of their action, to be revealed
by the knife of the anatomist.</p>

<p>If a lawyer make a mistake, for example in framing some
instrument, it is readily seen to be a mistake, and definite
and known results follow, clearly exposing his ignorance.
But if a quack, or a physician, through mistake in the
treatment of a case, destroy life, or fail to save it, when it
could be saved by the use of proper means, we can very
seldom have the opportunity of exposing such ignorance,
because as you have seen in the chapter on the Uncertainty
of Medicine, it is so difficult to connect effects in the human
system indisputably with their cause. Suppose the fatal
mistake is manifest to physicians, who happen to know the
facts in the case; how can they demonstrate it to the satisfaction
of the public? The only undoubted proofs of it
are often buried with the patient; and if they are not, but
are brought to light, even as clearly as in the case which I
have described, the community do not adequately appreciate
their value, as the honest and high-minded physician is
often pained to find, in his conversations on this subject
with even intelligent men. Many a popular and fashionable
physician, as well as the quack, is saved by the causes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
to which I have alluded from any effectual exposure of his
ignorance and unskillfulness.</p>

<p>I have said that it is by no means easy to cull out from
the mass of cases those in which the treatment must necessarily
affect the question of life and death. There are
inherent difficulties in the way of doing this. Even the
skillful and careful observer may mistake in the attempt to
do it, from the fact that the first appearance of a case does
not always indicate the amount of disease, nor its obstinacy.
While some cases, which appear of a grave character
at the outset, turn out to be mild ones, when the disturbance
of the attack is once over; those, on the other hand, which
seem to be mild, are sometimes found to contain in concealment
the elements of destruction. And if this difficulty
seriously embarrass the physician in making the selection
spoken of, much more then would it embarrass the community.</p>

<p>But there is another still more effectual obstacle, which
prevents the public from making this selection with any
degree of correctness. It is found in the representations,
which are made by different physicians and empirics, of
the cases under their care. There is great difference in
physicians in regard to the degree of hope which they
indulge in relation to their patients. One who is apt to be
desponding will, from this cause, make such representations
of the cases under his care, as will create the impression,
that his patients are much more gravely sick, than those
that are quite as sick under the care of another physician,
who has a strong tendency to hope. And besides this, some
make willful misrepresentations for their own selfish ends.
A very common artifice, for the purpose of gaining credit,
is to make great cases out of small ones. This is easily
done. I will suppose a case. A child is taken sick, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
the parents are full of anxiety. The physician sees at once
that the case is not at present a grave one, and that remedies
will probably in a short time give relief. If he be
honest he will say so, and remove the undue anxiety of the
parents. But if he be disposed, as many are, to make capital
out of the anxieties of his employers, he will say that
the child <em>is</em> very sick, and perhaps that ‘it is well you have
called me so soon,’ or, ‘I wish that you had called me before,
but I think on the whole that the little one <em>can</em> be relieved.’
Every physician knows how readily the imagination of a
parent may be excited in relation to the symptoms of disease
in a darling child. He has seen things believed to be true,
under the influence of such an excitement, which have not
the slightest foundation. How easy is it then in such a
case to practice deception, or at least to leave the parents
to deceive themselves with the figments of their own fancy.
If the physician manage adroitly, his skill will be proclaimed
with all the zeal which gratitude for a restored child can
prompt. How dishonest, how <em>cruel</em> is such a course! For
the sake of his own reputation, he has given poignancy to
the pangs of anxiety in the bosom of fond parents, when
it was plainly his duty to quiet their fears, by telling them
the true nature of the case.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The physician who practises such deception is indeed
occasionally detected; but if he have tact enough to avoid
being <em>often</em> detected, and if he have effrontery enough to
face down those who see through his arts, such occasional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
detection is but a small hindrance to success. In the case
which I have supposed, the friends of the physician of course
would claim for him, that there really was danger, and that
he had the sagacity to see what common eyes could not.
And the parents of the child would be very slow to believe
that all their fear and anxiety were unfounded. Their pride,
if nothing else, would prevent them from admitting this to
be true.</p>

<p>The risk of a real exposure of the deception being so
slight, it is not strange that selfish and cunning physicians
should be so fond of this artifice. Some acquire great skill
in the use of it, and contrive by this means to make many
tongues busy in proclaiming their wonderful cures.</p>

<p>The accounts, which empirics give of the cases under
their care, are very commonly misrepresentations. For,
from their ignorance of medicine, they are not capable of
appreciating in any just manner the character and amount
of disease, and the influence of remedies. And besides,
they have ordinarily very little regard for truth, the object
of most of them being to make the credulity of the public
subserve their pecuniary interests. They are accordingly
very loose in their ideas of disease, and often represent
things to be alike which have no real resemblance to
each other. The Thompsonians furnish constant illustrations
of this remark. If a man who was in pain has
obtained relief under their management, and some one else,
who had pain in the same part of the body, or somewhere
near it, has died under the care of a physician, they are
apt to say without any farther evidence, that the pain was
from the same cause in the two cases. So also, when scarlet
fever is prevalent, they often represent many as having
this disease, who have nothing but a common cold, or a
slight fever from disordered stomach, and thus get the credit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
with some people of cutting short a disease, which, under
the care of educated skill, cannot be prevented from going
through its natural course.</p>

<p>It is manifest that the misrepresentations, thus made by
many physicians, and by all empirics, must add much to the
difficulty of judging of the comparative success of different
remedies and modes of practice. And this difficulty is
much increased by the accretion of falsehood, which is certain
to be made to these misrepresentations, as busy rumor
passes them about in the community.</p>

<p>Another obstacle to the formation of a just estimate of
comparative success in medical practice, is found in the
influence of bad treatment upon cases, in which the disease
is small in amount and mild in its character. While the
judicious physician cures all such cases so readily, that they
excite no general interest, the unskillful practitioner and the
quack make bad cases of some of them; and yet they are
apt to end in recovery, although they appear to be of so
grave a character. For a case, which has become bad by
improper treatment, is not commonly in as dangerous a
condition, as one that has become bad in spite of good treatment.
In the latter case you see overpowering disease;
while in the former you see little more than the bad influence
of inappropriate medicine, which is apt to disappear
when the medicine is withheld. The common result of
such a case is, that at length the treatment is gradually given
up, and the patient, in consequence of its being given up,
gets well.</p>

<p>I will briefly cite two examples in illustration of this
point.</p>

<p>A gentleman, who had a friend sick under the care of a
physician, who was strongly in favor of the stimulating
mode of practice, was led to doubt the propriety of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
treatment, and as he watched the case he doubted more and
more. He at length ventured to lessen the amounts of
brandy and laudanum, taking care to conceal the fact from
the patient, who was every now and then calling for them,
because he felt a death-like sinking, and he was afraid that
his pulse was failing. He found that in proportion as he
lessened them the case improved, and he very soon discontinued
them altogether. There is not a doubt, that in this
case the stimulants, though affording temporary relief to the
patient’s sense of exhaustion, kept the man sick, and the
discontinuance of them was the cause of his recovery. A
similar experience has been detailed to me by others.</p>

<p>Such cases as the one which I have mentioned may
appear very badly, and yet the amount of disease may be
slight. Some disordered state of stomach, which a very
little appropriate medicine, with the aid of rest and a proper
diet, would remove, is often the whole of the disease.
I will give here the testimony of one among many physicians
to substantiate this assertion. The physician, to
whom I refer, told me, that when he began to practice,
there was an elder physician on the ground, who used
brandy and laudanum largely in a certain class of cases.
They were cases in which there was disordered stomach,
with considerable tendency to a depressed state of the
whole system. The patients were commonly sick from
one week to three, or even four weeks, and though they
excited much alarm among their friends, they all, with but
a single exception, finally recovered. He followed the example
of his elder friend for some time in similar cases, but
he soon began to doubt the propriety of such high stimulation.
The result was, that after a while he resorted to a
very simple practice in such cases, which produced entire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
relief in one or two days; whereas, under the stimulating
treatment, they would have been long and troublesome.</p>

<p>I might mention many cases from Thompsonian practice,
which would illustrate the same point, but it is not necessary.</p>

<p>Though the community do not generally distinguish between
cases which are necessarily of a grave character,
and those which are made so by bad treatment, there are
occasionally individuals, who do to some good extent make
this distinction.</p>

<p>A clergyman, who is blessed with a good share of plain
common sense, in addition to his high talents, and who has
uniformly eschewed quackery in medicine as well as in
theology, told me that he was once conversant with the
practice of two physicians of entirely opposite characters,
during the prevalence of an epidemic. The one gave large
amounts of medicine, and much of it was of a stimulating
nature. He had a great many very sick patients, and there
was much noise made about his wonderful cures. The
other went about among the sick very quietly, gave but
little medicine, and the number of his cases that were protracted
and severe was comparatively small.</p>

<p>Another instance which I will mention was that of a
gentleman, who employed a large number of men in a factory.
A great many of them were taken sick, one after
another, with what was called the “<em>sinking typhus</em>.” He observed
that some of them were but slightly ailing at first,
and were able to be about the house, but that after a while,
under the stimulating practice, they were laid upon their
beds. Some died, and many of them were severely sick
for some time. He doubted the propriety of the treatment,
and his doubts increased with every day’s observation. At
length he persuaded some who began to be sick to take some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
simple medicine, and not send for the physician. The result
was successful, and he recommended the same course to a
large number, none of whom became very sick.</p>

<p>As the community are not apt to make the discrimination
which was made by these two individuals, it is easy to see
how the injudicious physician and the quack often get the
credit of success, in their management of apparently grave
cases, when in fact these cases need never to have been
of this character, but they might have been cured at the
onset by a judicious course in a very short time, or perhaps
by the spontaneous efforts of the curative power of
nature. The unskillful and ignorant practitioner often
suffers disease to establish itself, and thus makes a long
case, though even ordinary skill would have succeeded
in at once breaking up the attack. And yet, when the
patient at last recovers, he may be applauded throughout a
neighborhood, perhaps a whole community, as having raised
the sick man almost from the dead, when perhaps in the
same neighborhood, in a case of a similar character, the
attack was successfully broken up, and no credit was given
to the skill which did it. This is a point on which undoubtedly
the public often give a wrong verdict in their estimate
of comparative success.</p>

<p>In order to show the readiness with which the public
commit errors, on the points to which I have alluded, in
their estimate of comparative success, I will suppose a case
which occurs not very unfrequently. Here are two rival
physicians side by side. The one is really skillful, and, if
the results of his practice could be justly estimated, he would
obtain great credit for success. He engages in medicine,
not as a mere trade, but as a noble science. He pursues
a straightforward, honorable, and quiet course, resorting
to no tricks to acquire business. The other, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
is unskillful, cares little for medicine as a science,
depends upon artifice, rather than real merit, to obtain
business, and, though he may desire to be successful, he
desires more that he may have the reputation of being so.
The issue which is made by these two physicians before
the public is a false one. Though the unskillful one loses
more patients than the other does, in proportion to the
whole number who come under his care; yet he perhaps
does not lose as many, in proportion to the number of
those which are considered bad cases by the community.
For he makes many cases to be bad ones which need not
to have been so, and, besides this, represents many as being
bad, that are really not attended with any danger.</p>

<p>Suppose, to make this clear, that, each physician has one
hundred cases of some prevailing epidemic—that each has
thirty bad cases—that the skillful physician loses five of
these, the unskillful one eight, the real balance being therefore
much against the latter. But the latter more than
compensates for this difference, by making ten bad cases
out of comparatively mild ones, of which he loses perhaps
but one or two, (such cases having, as I have before shown,
a strong tendency to recovery,) and by representing ten
others to be bad cases which are not so. How then stands
the account? The unskillful physician, has, it is true, lost
more patients than the other. But then, he has <em>appeared</em>
to have more cases of the epidemic fall into his hands; for,
while his rival has had but thirty bad cases, he reckons up
fifty of his as having been of this character, and the community
know but little of those cases which are acknowledged
to be mild ones—these make no noise, and are not
commonly taken into the account, in the estimates which
the public make on this subject.</p>

<p>I do not mean to be understood, by stating these results<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
in numbers, that the community generally estimate them
in this definite manner. I only present the subject in this
way in order to show, that, while the real results tell
strongly in favor of the skillful physician, even a numerical
estimate might tell against him; that is, as it would be
made out by the community, if they should attempt it. If
then an erroneous conclusion would be so apt to result from
any attempt at a numerical estimate on the part of the
community, much greater is the liability to error in the
vague general impressions which prevail on this subject.
Many an unsuccessful practitioner has obtained a greater
reputation for success than his really successful neighbor,
from the noise which is made about his <em>numerous</em> bad
cases.</p>

<p>I come now to speak of some other points of difference
in the results of good and bad treatment, in regard to which
the community are commonly even more deceived, than on
those of which I have already treated.</p>

<p>In managing a case, in which disease has become so
seated, that it cannot be broken up, but must be removed
gradually, it is evident that the more judicious are the
means which are applied from day to day to the varying
states of the case, the shorter will be the sickness. It is in
the accurate adjustment of remedial means to the ends to
be accomplished, that unskillfulness makes a great failure;
and yet it is a failure, which is for the most part concealed
from the public, because it can be satisfactorily detected
only by a nice comparison of cases. And this comparison
cannot be made by the public, for reasons which will soon
be stated.</p>

<p>But the adjustment of remedies to the varying states of
disease has an influence beyond the mere circumstance of
the length of the sickness. The judicious physician saves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
his patients from unnecessary complications in their diseases;
while the injudicious physician and the quack are
apt, not only to neglect to prevent or remove such complications,
but to excite and foster them. For example, if
there arise in the course of a case of fever some local inflammation,
the judicious physician notices the symptoms
of it, as soon as they appear, and immediately applies
remedies to remove it, and commonly succeeds in so doing.
On the other hand, unskilfulness would be blind to the fact
that such an inflammation exists, and would therefore make
no efforts to destroy it, but would perhaps unwittingly increase
it. The same difference between skilful and unskilful
practice could be pointed out in regard to other kinds
of complications—congestions, irritations, and functional
derangements of different organs.</p>

<p>But let us look beyond the results which occur during
the progress of disease, and examine those which appear
after recovery has taken place. When one recovers under
injudicious practice, his system is not apt to be in a good
state. His convalescence is not a clear one, and his recovery
is not full and complete. Perhaps his vital energies
are impaired, and his constitution has received unnecessarily
an injury, from which it may never wholly recover. Perhaps
some local chronic ailment is left behind, which,
though it may trouble him but slightly for a long time, may
yet be the germ of some future disease. Such a state of
things is not inconsistent with a tolerable condition of
health, even when there may be such disease, as will
gradually accumulate, till it bring him to a bed of sickness,
perhaps of death.</p>

<p>These remote consequences of bad practice are the more
certain to occur, if the patient go on, after recovery, to
administer medicines to himself according to his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
whims, or those of others. Many very tedious cases of
this kind fall at length under the care of physicians, from
the hands of quacks, who are thus often spared from witnessing
the results of their ignorance and imposture, and
from bearing, in the estimation of the public, any responsibility
in relation to them.</p>

<p>The influence of bad practice upon the health of families,
it is evident from the above facts, must be very great; and
yet it is seldom appreciated at all, and never as fully as it
should be. There is no question of the fact that there is
generally a much larger amount of sickness, from year to
year, in families that employ unskilful physicians or
empirics, than there is in those who are under the care of
skilful practitioners. And though the public cannot discriminate
accurately between individual cases in regard to
this point, they can see the evidence of this general fact,
especially in comparing good practice with gross quackery.
This evidence will go on to increase, inasmuch as the evil
effects of quackery, continued in a family from year to year,
are constantly accumulating; a result which is materially
aided by the unnecessary dosing, commonly pursued by
them in the intervals of sickness. And from this accumulation
we may infer, that what we now see of the bad consequences
of quackery is but a shadow of what we may
see hereafter.</p>

<p>Let us now sum up the points in which the practice of
the really skilful physician differs in its results, from that of
the injudicious practitioner, and the quack.</p>

<p>1. He has a less number of fatal cases in proportion to
the whole number that come under treatment.</p>

<p>2. He has a less number of bad cases, because he
avoids converting light cases into grave ones, and succeeds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
in arresting disease in many cases in its very commencement.</p>

<p>3. His patients have commonly a shorter sickness.</p>

<p>4. They are in a better condition after they have
recovered—less apt to have bad results left behind, and less
liable to disease in future.</p>

<p>5. He has a less number of patients, and a smaller
amount of sickness, in the same number of families. In
order to discover this difference between skilful and unskilful
practice, the observation must be extended over some
length of time, and quite a large number of families.</p>

<p>That these points of difference between the results of
good, and those of bad practice, may be appreciated with
any correctness, two things are necessary.</p>

<p>First. We must have a sufficient quantity of evidence.
A few facts will not avail in deciding such points—they
will only lead to erroneous conclusions. Comparison is to
be made, it is true, between individual cases, but there
must be many of them in order to secure the avoidance of
error.</p>

<p>The second requisite is the capability of observing
correctly. I have altogether failed of obtaining one of my
principal objects in this and the previous chapters, if the
reader’s mind is not strongly impressed with the great
liability to error, which attends careless and unskilful observation
in medicine. There is no subject, in the wide
range of human knowledge, the investigation of which
requires more care and skill than this does.</p>

<p>Now it is obvious, that the community in general are
very deficient in these two requisites for a proper appreciation
of the comparative results of practice. Most men
have a very narrow range of facts, upon which they can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
found such an appreciation. Their observation of sickness
extends little beyond their immediate family circle; for
what they see of disease any where else is not like watching
over it, and what they hear, as you have already seen,
is not to be relied upon. There is much which is styled
fact that is not so—it is either mis-statement, or the result
of hasty and superficial observation. The actual knowledge
which any non-professional observer obtains of
disease, by any observation of his own, to which he gives
any fair amount of attention is very narrow. This assertion
may be offensive to many, who are accustomed to
utter their opinions, in regard to the results of medical
practice, with almost the authority of an oracle. But it is
nevertheless true.</p>

<p>But, the reader will say, if it be so difficult, and almost
impossible, for me to discriminate between good and bad
practice, by my own observation of their results, what
shall I do? How shall I judge of the different modes of
practice, and of the skill of different physicians? In answer
to this enquiry, I remark, that if the reader is really convinced
by what I have said, that it is almost impossible for
him to judge of practice by the results which come within
the compass of his observation, then it is plain that he must
give up, for the most part, this source of evidence as a
deceptive one, and rely upon other means for arriving at
correct conclusions on these points. What these means
are I shall point out in the chapter on Popular Estimates
of Physicians.</p>

<p>I think that physicians often err in their readiness to
appeal to results, to show the public the superiority of their
practice to that of the quack. There is no objection to
such an appeal, when a sufficient number of well-observed
and authenticated facts can be produced, bearing upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
point in question. But this cannot ordinarily be done,
when the community are to pass judgment in the case.
The quack likes to join issue with the physician here, for
he knows how easily the public are deceived in relation to
facts, and he makes his appeal before them to results with
a bold confidence. The proprietor of a patent medicine
points you to his wonderful cures, as the facts which must
convince every one of its efficacy and value. The
Thompsonian, with his red pepper and lobelia and steam,
claims that he is right and every body else wrong, and
appeals to his successful results as the proof. The Homœopathist
comes with his little globules, and says that, laugh
as you may at the tiny doses, his appeal is to the cures,
which he claims they effect as if by magic. Talk with
some physician who has adopted this mode of practice from
purely mercenary views, and who is rather ashamed of it,
(for there are such physicians)—ply him with argument,
to show the fallacy of his doctrines—drive him from one
strong hold to another; and at last you will come to his
citadel, in which he feels perfectly secure from all your
shafts. He will tell you, with a cool kind of defiance that
you have not seen in him before, ‘there are the facts—our
medicines cure disease, and the people are beginning to see
the truth.’ The Hydropathist too will point you to narratives
of scores of patients, cured of all sorts of maladies by
nothing but a cold wet blanket, and will say, ‘wonderful as
it may seem, there are the results.’</p>

<p>So it ever has been. The same appeal has been made
in behalf of all the delusions that have ever obtained a
currency in any community. The Indian who performs
his strange and uncouth manœuvres, and utters his howling
incantations over his patient, and the Chilian doctor who
blows vehemently about the bed of the sick, both, like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
Thompsonian, and the Homœopath, and the Hydropath,
appeal to their facts, their cures, as the sure proof of the
efficacy of their practice. The royal touch, the weapon
ointment, the tar water of Bishop Berkeley,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and the
metallic tractors of Dr. Perkins, were each in their time in
the same way proved, to the satisfaction of the great
public, to be wonderfully successful in the cure of disease.
An array of facts appeared in favor of the last mentioned
of these delusions, Perkinism, that surpassed altogether the
results which are now attributed to Homœopathy. But
time has shown that the results were falsely attributed—a
fact which should teach the public a lesson, in regard to the
apparent results which are appealed to in support of the
delusions of the present day.</p>

<p>But must the physician say nothing about results to
the public? Certainly he should.</p>

<p>In the first place, he should endeavor to guard those, with
whom he has daily intercourse, against erroneous views of
results in medicine, by showing them the difficulties that lie
in the way of estimating them with correctness. If he
succeeds at all in producing a proper impression upon their
minds, and thus induces them to be modest and careful,
instead of being bold and heedless, as too many are, in
expressing their opinions on such subjects, he will exert an
effectual influence, in preventing them from being deluded
by the partial views of facts, and the mis-statements, upon
which empiricism relies for its success.</p>

<p>In the second place, whenever he can make a comparison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
between the results of good practice and those of quackery,
<em>which can be fairly understood</em>, let him do it. To warrant
such a comparison the facts should be clear, well authenticated,
and in sufficient number to justify the general conclusions
drawn from them.</p>

<p>In the third place, whenever he can show, by facts which
can be appreciated by the common observer, that the practice
pursued by any pretender has been entirely inappropriate
to any case, especially if this can be done by evidence
discovered in an examination after death, let him do it, and
explain with all clearness the nature of that evidence to the
friends of the patient, and, if necessary, to the community.
At the same time, he should avoid joining in with the
popular disposition to ascribe death to the treatment pursued
as a matter of course, whether the proof be or be not
satisfactory.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> There is no doubt that death is frequently
the consequence of bad practice, when it cannot be proved
to be so; but not even the quack, murderous as his course
certainly is, should be condemned upon faulty and defective
evidence.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> The above remarks may be applied to an exclusive system quite popular
just now—I refer to Hydropathy. Cold water is a valuable remedial
agent, used both internally and externally, as the recorded experience of
medical men abundantly proved long before Priesnitz appeared on the
stage. But the indiscriminate and exclusive use of it, which is prescribed
by his system, is as bad practice as the indiscriminate and exclusive use of
anything else—and <em>a full and impartial record of Hydropathic practice
would show it to be so</em>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> When an epidemic is prevalent, such a physician instead of allaying
the undue public excitement, as it is his duty to do, increases it by his very
grave and wise air of conversation, and by his reports of his cases, of which
he is apt to have more than his neighbors, and to be of course very successful
in their treatment. Even when there are only distant rumors of
the epidemic, he has occasion to report to gossiping circles some cases
which at least come <em>very near</em> to being true cases of it.</p>

up a quart of his panacea. He was an illustrious man, but he held two

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> The bare fact that death results is obviously no proof of the want of
skill, any more than the bare fact that a case has ended in recovery is proof
of the possession of skill. But the disposition to which I have alluded is
quite common, and gives rise to many unjust conclusions in regard to the
merits of physicians. Hence physicians often manifest, in various ways, a
dread of having the charge of cases, which are sure to end fatally. Some,
to avoid the imputation of “bad luck,” as it is expressed, often manage
adroitly to throw such cases off from their own hands into those of some
neighboring practitioner, or some empiric, before death actually occurs.</p>

<span class="fs80">THEORY AND OBSERVATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>All real knowledge is based upon observation; and it is
the facts discovered by observation, which, accumulating
from age to age, constitute the <em>store</em> of human knowledge.
Not a single grain has ever been added to this store, in all
the ages of the world, through the instrumentality of theory
alone. Theory, or hypothesis, has often suggested the existence
of facts, and has directed in the pursuit after them,
but observation after all is the only agent that has discovered
them.</p>

<p>Facts are of two kinds—particular and general. General
facts are discovered by a careful observation of a great
number of particular facts. Thus Newton, by observing
many particular or individual facts, established the general
fact, which is called gravitation, viz., that all bodies are
attracted towards each other, or have a tendency to come
together. So in medical science, by an observation of many
facts in individual cases, it has been discovered, that there
is a tendency in the human system to restoration to health,
whenever it is attacked with disease—a tendency, existing
as a general fact, to which has been given the name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis
medicatrix naturæ</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>These general facts are sometimes termed principles or
laws, and are sometimes spoken of as the relationships of
facts. A theory, or hypothesis, consists in a supposition of
relationships which have not yet been ascertained. Thus
Newton, after discovering the great general fact of gravitation,
supposed that there might be a sort of ether connecting
bodies together, and acting as the medium of their
attraction. This supposition of a relationship, or general
fact, not yet ascertained, is a theory or hypothesis. So
when Stahl supposed the principle called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix
naturæ</i> to be in the soul, and when Cullen supposed that it
exists in the nerves and produces in fever a spasm of the extreme
vessels, they both put forth a mere theory. Cullen
speaks of Stahl’s theory as being fanciful. It is so. But
Cullen’s is just as fanciful, if by this word it is meant that
it is unsubstantiated by fact. Cullen’s supposition is more
plausible, it is true, than Stahl’s; but it is no nearer being
a proved fact.</p>

<p>There is often much indefiniteness in the use of the word
<em>theory</em>. Thus the doctrine, or law of gravitation, as discovered
by Newton is sometimes spoken of as his <em>theory</em> of
gravitation. It was <em>once</em> his theory; that is, when it was
a mere supposition in his mind. But when, by a series of
observations it came to be a proved fact, it was no longer a
theory. So the laws of the circulation of the blood, as discovered
by Harvey, are sometimes erroneously spoken of as
his theory of the circulation.</p>

<p>Some theories are said to be founded on facts, while
others are deemed to be very fanciful. But theory can
never be said, strictly speaking, to be founded on facts. It
has relation to facts, it is true, but in the attempt to explain
their nature, it goes <em>beyond</em> them over into the domain of
conjecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>Every one who puts forth a theory, is apt to think that
all previous theories are false, while his is proved to be conformable
to facts. Dr. Cullen, in announcing his theory,
or doctrine (as he styles it) of fever, which is from beginning
to end a series of unproved assertions, says, “I flatter
myself that I have avoided hypothesis, and what have been
called theories.” So Dr. Rush, after framing a theory even
more palpably fanciful, says, that he conceives the doctrine
of fever that he has aimed to establish rests upon facts
only.</p>

<p>There is no science, in which there has been so much
theorizing, as there has been in that of medicine. Its history
seems to be almost altogether a history of untenable
theories. These theories are at least the prominent objects
that present themselves to view. Every period has had its
favorite theory, which has exerted its influence upon the
general medical mind. Almost every great name in medical
history is associated with some celebrated hypothesis.
And it would seem that sometimes the attention of the
whole profession has been almost exclusively directed to
the strife between the advocates of opposing theories.
This overweening attachment to theories has been a very
great obstacle to the advancement of medicine as a science.
It has turned the medical mind away from the legitimate
pathway of discovery, and the strict observation of facts
has been neglected in the contemplation of mere fancies.</p>

<p>It is true of medicine, as it is of every other science, that
every advance which has been made has been effected by
observation, and by observation alone. It is the good observer,
and not the mere ingenious theorizer, who has made
these advances. And if the theorizer has added anything
to the store of knowledge, it is only when he has come
down from his airy flight of fancy to the drudgery of humble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
common observation. He has for the time forgotten his
favorite theory, and has subjected hypothesis to its proper
subserviency to observation, in suggesting the points to
which that observation may be directed. It is in this way,
and in this alone, that many of the authors of theories,
escaping occasionally from the domination of a theorizing
spirit, have added rich treasures to the storehouse of medical
science. Even before the discovery of the circulation
of the blood, though medical theories necessarily contained
many absurdities, yet many of their advocates were acute
and accurate observers; and their facts are valuable, though
the theories, which they framed to account for these facts,
may appear to us even ridiculous. They collected a great
amount of good materials; but instead of erecting with
them a structure full of beauty and symmetry, capable of
resisting the commotions of ages, they reared a motley pile
which easily tumbled into ruins. They were men of the
most persevering industry. They seemed to forget entirely
that “of making many books there is no end; and much
study is a weariness of the flesh.” Quartos and folios were
produced in abundance, full of mixtures of wisdom and
folly, as incongruous as were some of the old prescriptions
with their hundred or more ingredients. And as some of
the articles, which composed these hundred-headed enemies
of disease, are now among our most valuable remedies, so
there are portions of those strange compounds of fact and
speculation, which will always stand as monuments of
genius and industry. They are among the principles which
form the basis of medicine. The student, as he now reads
the older works in medical science, regards but as matters
of curiosity the theories of lentor and viscosity, acrimony,
&amp;c.; and picks out from the mass of rubbish the pearls and
precious stones, which are almost concealed beneath it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>The reader cannot fail to have seen, in the course of my
remarks, what I deem to be the province of theory, or
hypothesis. It is simply suggestive. This is its true vocation.
It <em>establishes</em> no fact, and no principle. It should
be the mere handmaid of observation, and should be kept
in perfect subjection to her control. It never should be a
rival, much less should it have supremacy, as it has too
often done, in the domains of science.</p>

<p>Thus restricted to its proper sphere, theory is of essential
service in extending the boundaries of science. It often
suggests the line of discovery. It constantly reaches
beyond present knowledge. We theorize, that is, we suppose;
then by observation we discover. If we find our
hypothesis or supposition to be correct, we discover a
positive fact. If we find it not to be, we discover a negative
fact, and not valueless because negative—some of our
negative facts are worth quite as much as positive ones.</p>

<p>The abuse of theory consists in the obliteration of the
distinction between what is known, and what is merely
supposed. So long as this distinction is carefully preserved,
no harm is done by theory. No man was ever more
thorough, in maintaining this line of separation between
the known and the supposed, than was Newton. “<em>I shall
not mingle conjectures with certainties</em>,” a passage in a
letter announcing his great discovery of the compound
nature of light, is a maxim which always governed him,
and should govern every searcher after truth in every
branch of science.</p>

<p>This maxim has evidently been little regarded by the
great majority of theorizers in medicine. They have
exalted mere conjectures into the same rank with facts;
and so far as they have done this, just so far have they
exerted an influence to retard the progress of medical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
science. If all the energy and talent, which have been
expended upon theories, could have been directed to the
observation of facts, what a mass of rubbish, which now
encumbers the science of medicine, would have remained
uncollected, and what an amount of pure unadulterated
facts, which as yet are undiscovered, would have been
garnered into the storehouse of knowledge!</p>

<p>As observation then is the only source of improvement
in medical science, it is important to inquire what influences
are adverse to <em>skill</em> in the observer. The influence
of an overweening fondness for theory has already been
sufficiently pointed out. I will pass therefore to the consideration
of some other circumstances which tend to
impair skill in observation.</p>

<p>Every physician can add much to his stock of knowledge
by a proper review of cases which have come under his
care. But a faulty mode of doing this will lead him into
error. For example, one physician is so exceedingly fearful
that in those cases, in which death has occurred, something
which he did or left undone was the cause of the fatal
event that he sees nothing clearly, and arrives at no definite
and available conclusions; and he ends every review with
nothing but unavailing regrets. Another, on the contrary,
is too self-confident, scarcely harboring the idea that he
could have ever committed any error. This notion of
infallibility, though not distinctly avowed, is indulged to a
greater or less extent by many physicians. If they do not
think that they <em>never</em> err, they at least think that it is very
uncommon for them to do so. To such the past is worth
nothing as corrective. They add from it nothing to their
stock of ascertained facts, though they may add to their
medley of true and false inferences. Both of these
extremes should be avoided. The physician, in reviewing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
his cases, should not fear to find errors; for if he investigated
them properly at the time with the best lights
which he could command, and acted in good faith, he is not
to be blamed if he did err. But, on the other hand, he
should not pronounce any measure which he has adopted
to be an error without substantial evidence.</p>

<p>The disposition to form conclusions from a limited
number of facts is a fertile source of error in medical observation.
This has already been alluded to in previous chapters.</p>

<p>This disposition is very common among young physicians.
A small number of cases is often sufficient to lead them to
adopt conclusions, which a larger number of cases would
show to be false. The fact that their experience has been
limited should teach them to be cautious in their inferences;
but very often this caution is never learned, till a larger
experience has revealed to them their errors. The disposition
under consideration is often increased, and sometimes
rendered inveterate, by the practice, so common especially
among young aspirants for medical fame, of speaking quite
freely in non-professional circles of the results of their
experience. This practice is not only disgusting, but it
contributes essentially to the establishment of a habit of
loose observation and reasoning.</p>

<p>But the disposition to adopt conclusions from a limited
observation is by no means confined to young practitioners.
It is a very common error in the profession at large; and
the annals of medical experience are loaded down with
errors, which come from this source. A few illustrations
will suffice.</p>

<p>A few years ago a pamphlet appeared from the pen of
Dr. Sewall of Washington, on the pathology of drunkenness,
with plates exhibiting the state of the drunkard’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
stomach in different stages of disease. Among others is a
plate representing the appearance of the stomach of a man
who died of delirium tremens; and Dr. Sewall says, that it
is a true representation of the state of the stomach in all
these who die of this malady. This sweeping assertion is
based upon nothing but his personal observation, which, it
seems from his own account, was very limited. He speaks
of having had <em>several</em> opportunities of inspecting the stomach
after death in such cases, and says that the appearances
on dissection have been extremely uniform. How
many he meant by the word ‘several’ I know not; but one
thing is certain—that nothing short of <em>many</em> observations
could establish the fact, that the plate in question exhibits
the true state of the stomach in <em>all</em> cases of death by delirium
tremens.</p>

<p>Now what is the truth on this point? This question is
not to be answered by what any <em>one</em> man has found in
‘several,’ or even in many cases. It can be properly
answered, only by taking the observations of many different
physicians, who have had extensive opportunities of
making examinations after death in this disease. The uniformity
of appearances, spoken of by Dr. Sewall, we find,
has not been observed by others; but the stomach has been
found in various states in the different cases.</p>

<p>Dr. Sewall infers from the appearances in his cases, that
the opinion advocated by some, that delirium tremens has
its seat in the stomach is correct. Even if such appearances
were competent proof in regard to this point, which
is by no means true, it would require a larger number of
cases than can properly be included under the term ‘several,’
to establish the correctness of such a conclusion. It
is worthy of remark here, that others, taking, like Dr.
Sewall, the partial view of facts presented by a limited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
experience, but having their attention directed to another
quarter, have located this disease in some other organ.
Thus some have supposed its seat to be in the brain, and
have based this opinion, as Dr. Sewall did his, upon what
they found in examinations after death. The truth is that
all the phenomena of this disease show, that is a peculiar
affection of the nervous system, and not a local disease of
any one organ. Now in the general disordered condition
of the drunkard’s organs, this affection is of course liable
to be complicated with various local diseases. And delirium
tremens of itself alone is not apt to end fatally; but when
death occurs, it is ordinarily the result of some local complaint
united with this disease. Wherever this complaint
happens to be,—in the stomach, or the liver, or the brain,
or some other organ,—<em>there</em> will be found on examination
after death the greatest amount of disease. And a partial
view of facts has often led physicians to mistake these
local complications of delirium tremens for the disease
itself.</p>

<p>Another error, of a more directly practical character,
which existed for a long time in relation to this same disease,
will serve as another illustration of the influence of
a partial view of facts, in leading to wrong conclusions.
Dr. Sutton, one of the early authors on delirium tremens,
asserted as the result of his observation, that the patient
must sleep or die, and that opium in <em>large</em> doses was the
proper remedy to produce the sleep. This opinion was for
a long time almost universally adopted, and practised upon.
But the compared experience of <em>many</em> observers has demonstrated
this practice to be erroneous, and it is now very
commonly given up by the profession.</p>

<p>In examining disease, whether in a single case, or in
groups of cases, it is essential to the formation of correct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
conclusions, that <em>all</em> the symptoms be observed, and that
their relative importance be duly estimated. Much error
has arisen from a disregard of this plain truth. Take for
example the observations of different individuals in regard
to fever. Boerhaave, looking mainly at one class of symptoms,
taught that fever was caused by a bad state of the
blood; Cullen looking at another class of symptoms, considered
fever to be an affection of the nervous system;
Clutterbuck, fixing his eye upon another class of facts, was
very sure that the cause of fever is always to be found in
the brain; Broussais, directing his attention to the symptoms
developed in another quarter of the system, asserted,
that all fever arises from an inflammation of the mucous
membrane of the stomach and of the upper portion of the
intestines; Dr. Cooke of this country, narrowing his vision
down to a certain set of symptoms, proclaimed that the
primary cause of fever is a weakened action of the heart,
producing an accumulation of blood in the venous system;
and Samuel Thompson, following in his rude way the example
of all previous theorizers on this subject, in taking into
view but a part of the facts in the case, declared that fever
is a battle between the cold and the heat, and that, if the
cold conquer, the patient dies, and if the heat gain the victory,
the patient lives.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>It is thus that a disposition to form conclusions from a
limited experience, and to take partial views of facts, leads
to errors of opinion, and consequently errors of practice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
I might multiply illustrations on this point, but it is not
necessary.</p>

<p>Allied to the influence just mentioned is another, to which
I will give a passing notice. I refer to the hobby-riding
which is so common in the medical profession. Every good
thing seems to be destined to this use till it loses its novelty;
and therefore its real value can never be accurately ascertained,
till it has passed what may be called the <em>hobby-period</em>
of its existence. No careful discriminations are made to
any extent until this period is finished. Even the experience,
which is recorded in journals of medicine during its
continuance, needs to be thoroughly sifted by after observation.
The influence of this hobby-riding is therefore a
great hindrance to the progress of medical science. And
this influence is not confined to the particular subjects to
which it is applied. It does not merely throw obstacles in
the way of <em>their</em> investigation. It is not thus limited and
evanescent, for it is counter to the true <em>spirit of observation</em>,
and impairs its hold upon the profession as a whole.</p>

<p>The riding of hobbies is very much regulated by fashion.
For there is a fashion in medicine as well as in everything
else; and it not only bears rule in the community at large,
but it exercises no inconsiderable authority in the medical
profession itself. Some particular diseases and modes of
treatment, are ever, sometimes one, and sometimes another,
uppermost in the popular mind.</p>

<p>When anything new comes up in regard to disease or its
treatment, which attracts considerable attention, there is a
strong temptation to make a hobby of it. Multitudes suppose
that they have the disease, and need the treatment.
This may be really true of but few of them, but such is
their belief. There is no time for accurate discrimination
if the object be to make fame and money. If a physician<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
honestly undertakes to decide what cases need the treatment,
and what do not, he will not be as successful in gaining
eclat, and in getting the people’s money, as his neighbor
will be, who catches the popular breeze with all his sails,
knowing that it is not wont to blow in one direction for any
length of time.</p>

<p>A few years ago dyspepsia was very fashionable; but
now it is so old-fashioned, that we hear but little about it,
and no hobby-rider thinks at the present day of setting up
any pretensions to great skill in the treatment of this complaint.
Diseases of the throat have taken its place in the
public mind, and multitudes are running to those, who are
reputed to have peculiar skill in clipping off tonsils and
palates, and swabbing out windpipes. The new treatment,
as it is called, is good practice in some cases; but the almost
indiscriminate application which some hobby-doctors make
of it is ridiculous and contemptible. The confirmed consumptive,
who has his palate clipped, or his throat or windpipe
swabbed, and because he fancies that he feels better,
revives for a time the delusive hope of recovery, and cheerfully
pays the doctor his fee, has a most unjustifiable cheat
practised upon him. And such fees! From five to twenty
dollars, according to the circumstances of the patient, is
asked by some of these doctors for clipping the palate, one
of the most trifling operations in surgery.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>When this fashion shall have passed by, as pass it will,
like all other fashions before it, and this hobby shall have
ceased to be ridden, how little will be the actual knowledge
of diseases of the throat and windpipe, which will be found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
to be added to the stock of information in the possession of
the profession by those, who have now the reputation in the
community of being very skilful in the treatment of these
complaints! Some, who have had less eclat, and have
therefore reaped less pecuniary benefit, will have made the
proper discriminations; and to them will the profession be
indebted for all that has been really discovered in relation
to the nature and treatment of these diseases.</p>

<p>A habit of making loose and exaggerated statements has
become so common in the medical profession, that it is
really no small obstacle in the way of the accumulation
of accurate observations in medicine. The credulity of
the public tempts to an indulgence in such statements, in
the common intercourse of physicians with those who are
around them, and to whom they relate their cases, and state
the results of their experience. If they yield to the temptation,
the habit grows, and it inevitably begets and fosters
another habit—that of loose observation. The statements
of such physicians are not to be relied upon, even when
they appear on the pages of some medical journal. Much
of the recorded experience of the profession is undoubtedly
from this cause worse than valueless.</p>

<p>I mention as another very common cause of inaccurate
observation in medicine, an easy credulity, and a consequent
fondness for novelty and change. It is a very prevalent
opinion that the medical profession is opposed, as a general
thing, to anything which is new, and that it really thus
stands in the way of the march of improvement. This
may have been true once, when the authority of antiquity
held an almost undisputed supremacy over all the votaries
of learning and science. But it is far from being true now.
One of the prominent faults of the medical profession in
the nineteenth century is, on the other hand, that it is as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
body too fond of new things, and too much disposed to
receive them upon doubtful evidence. There is a great
disposition to hail every new remedy with enthusiasm.
The annals of medicine are therefore burdened with false
statements in regard to the effects of remedies. Though
the public think that there have been of late many discoveries
of new medicines of great value, there really have
been but few. There have been many improvements in
the <em>forms</em> of medicines. I mention as examples, quinine
and morphine, the active principles of bark and opium.
But there have been but few absolutely new medicines
introduced which are of any importance. Many have
been announced with much flourish, and have been extensively
used for a time, but the confidence which has been
put in them has in most cases been found to be misplaced.
And it may be remarked, that physicians, who try all the
new remedies recommended from time to time in medical
journals, do not add so much to their stock of available
experience, as those do who are more cautious, and less
ready to adopt everything which is new.</p>

<p>The science of medicine, in all its departments, is in a
very changeable state. The discoveries, which are made
from time to time in anatomy, physiology, and pathology,
the theories which are put forth, and the new remedies, and
modes of treatment which are continually proposed, keep
up a constant excitement in the profession. In this unsettled
state of things, with so many novelties to attract the
attention, the temptation is so strong to act as a mere gazer,
and, setting aside the labor of investigation, to adopt what
is asserted upon deficient evidence, that there is the more
need of maintaining that cautious observation, which is the
only preventive of error.</p>

<p>I cannot forbear to notice here one circumstance, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
exerts a great influence in favoring the unsettled state of
medicine, and consequently in encouraging the fondness for
new things. I refer to the fact, that there are no authorities,
properly so called in medicine. The theologian has his
standard authors, who are a kind of authority to which he
appeals, and above all, he has the Bible as an unerring standard,
and every opinion which is advanced he can bring to
this test. The lawyer also has his standard works, in which
are embodied the principles of law, and they are settled
authorities to which he can appeal. In medicine, on the
other hand, though there are works which contain the principles
of the science, they have none of that fixed and
undisputed authority, which standard works on other subjects
are apt to have. There is therefore a contempt of
authority in matters of opinion in medicine tolerated by
the community, and even by the profession, which is not
tolerated in regard to any other subject. While the lawyer
appeals to ‘the law,’ and the divine to ‘the law and the testimony,’
the doctor often assumes the right of disputing all
authorities from Hippocrates down to the present time. If
a lawyer should, with bold and thoughtless assurance, call
in question a decision of Chief Justice Marshall, he would
be treated with contempt by both the bar and the community.
But the most ignorant pretender in medicine may
even gain credit, and what is of more importance to him,
money too, by setting up a bold front against the whole
faculty, and declaring, as Hahneman and Thompson each has
done, that the medical world was in total darkness till he
arose to enlighten it. So in theology, such gross delusions
as Mormonism and Millerism are looked upon with mingled
pity and contempt by the public, and yet that same public
will patronize delusions in medicine which are not a whit
less fanciful and ridiculous.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>One more cause of inaccurate observation remains to be
noticed. It is one, however, which, at the present time at
least, is so uncommon, that it cannot have any extensive
influence. I refer to scepticism. When it does exist, it
not only narrows the limits of knowledge, but actually leads
to positive error. The sceptic, in his demand for stern,
fixed facts, rejects some facts, which are established by evidence
that is sufficient to satisfy any mind possessed of
candor and common sense; and the rejection of a well-proved
fact, being itself an error, must necessarily lead to
other errors. The sceptic too, with all his doubting, is
always, to some extent, and on some points, a credulous
man. As he doubts on some points against clear evidence,
so he will assuredly believe on others against evidence just
as clear. His beliefs are no more worthy of confidence
than his doubts. The sceptic is therefore disqualified by
his scepticism for accurate observation. This is especially
true in the practice of medicine, because, as you have seen,
there is so much uncertainty in it, and the physician is
obliged to base so much of his treatment upon probabilities.
Some one has said, that the best guesser is the best practitioner.
There is some truth in this remark, though it is
of course by no means strictly true. It is well for the physician
to guess when facts are wanting, but he must be
careful not to esteem his guesses to be facts, as is too often
done.</p>

<p>In medicine, as well as in every other science, but little
mental effort is required to frame theories. All the hard work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
which is done—the work by which all knowledge is accumulated—is
the work of <em>observation</em>. It therefore needs a
higher order of mind to ascertain facts and their relationships,
than it does to theorize. “Any man,” says Pott, an
eminent English surgeon, “may give an opinion, but it is
not every mind that is qualified to collect and arrange
important facts.”</p>

<p>It is important that the physician should have at the outset
good habits of observation. If he does, every day’s
experience will add to his store of facts, and at the same
time relieve it from some of the chaff of error which has
been brought in unawares. <em>He will be all the time becoming
a better practitioner.</em> But, on the other hand, if he
start with a loose habit of observation, experience will be
to him a source of error. He will have no <em>clean store</em> of
facts, but he will garner in a strange mixture of facts,
and suppositions, and errors; and every day’s experience
will add to the difficulty of separating the good grain from
the mass of refuse, with which it is mingled. <em>He will be
all the time becoming a poorer practitioner.</em></p>

<p>The idea then that experience will <em>at any rate</em> confer
knowledge is a false idea. It is not true, that the old physician,
<em>as a matter of course</em>, knows more than he did when
he was young. If he has observed well, he does know
more; but if he has not observed well, he not only does
not know more, but he knows less. In the latter case, he
may indeed have more ideas and opinions than he had when
he began his practice, but he does not know as many real
ascertained facts, and those which he does know are so
encumbered with the long accumulating rubbish of error,
that they are of little use to him.</p>

<p>It is easier to adopt a theory with a corresponding system
of remedial means, or even to originate one, than it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
is to encounter the labor of strict daily observation at the
bedside of the sick. Many physicians pursue the former
course, and go through with a routine of practice from year
to year. If they have some tact in managing the capricious
credulity of the public, they succeed in attaining the
object at which they aim. These followers of a <em>system</em> are
generally considered by the community as very rational
and scientific men. Some of them, though they live on
the opinions advanced, and the facts discovered by others,
contrive to get up quite a reputation for originality, by
making so much account of these opinions and facts, that
the public awards to them, in part at least, the credit of their
discovery. It gives them a sort of eclat to stand out from
their medical brethren, as the advocates of some peculiarity
of doctrine or practice.</p>

<p>The medical profession has had too much to do with
theories, and modes, and systems. Every prominent theory
can be shown to be unsubstantiated by facts, and is therefore
valueless. Every mode, or system of practice, however
numerous are the facts which are adduced for its
support, can be shown to exclude many facts of a valuable
character; and being thus exclusive, it must lead to practical
error. <em>All these systems therefore should be discarded.</em>
A true eclecticism should be introduced into medicine, and
it should have relation not to opinions and theories, but to
facts only. Whenever a fact is really ascertained, it should
be treasured up in the storehouse, ready for practical use.
If it be apparently inconsistent with other facts, this is no
reason for rejecting it. If it be really proved, it should be
received, and its consistency with other facts may afterward
be discovered. Indeed, quite a large proportion of
the facts practically applied in medicine, are <em>independent</em>
facts, neither explained themselves, nor capable as yet of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
being used in the explanation of other facts. I have alluded
to this point before. A single example here will suffice.
No fact in medicine is better established than that arsenic
in almost all cases cures hemicrania, or periodical neuralgia
on one side of the head. How or why it does this no one
knows. The bare fact is known.</p>

<p>In this connexion I will make a remark or two upon a
subject which is often the topic of conversation in common
as well as professional circles, viz., the modus operandi of
medicines, or the mode by which they cure disease. It is
a common, but a very erroneous idea, that this subject is
easily understood, and much reproach is cast upon physicians
for their differences of opinion in relation to it. The
modus operandi of many remedies is, as I have already
said, wholly unknown, and the knowledge which we have
of it in any case is more or less imperfect. And after all,
though it may gratify curiosity to know <em>how</em> a medicine
cures disease, it is comparatively a matter of little importance.
The fact that it does so is the material fact. The
knowledge, which it is practically important to obtain in
relation to any remedy, is a knowledge of its effects, and
of the circumstances which modify them. And physicians,
however much they may speculate about the modus operandi
of medicines, commonly view this subject in this
practical light at the bedside of the sick. The question
whether opium is essentially a sedative or a stimulant is
forgotten, when a patient suffering the tortures of spasmodic
colic is to be relieved. The material fact is, that it can
relieve the pain—<em>how</em> it will do it is not just then a subject
of consideration.</p>

<p>A reform is now in progress in the medical profession.
The struggle to break loose from theory is fairly begun. A
deep consciousness, that the science of medicine is cumbered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
by a mass of rubbish, has awakened a disposition to
a more careful and rigid observation. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Materia Medica</i>
of the profession is especially burdened in this way.
The virtues which are attributed to a large portion of the
remedies in use require to be tested in order to strip the
statements which are made in regard to them of all that is
inaccurate and false. Much of the positive medication of
the present day will probably be proved by the tests of a
rigid observation to be <em>aimless</em>, but by no means harmless.
The over-dosing, which has been so much in vogue both
with the community and the profession, is already fast
losing its popularity. Heretofore the great object of the
physician has been to do <em>positive good</em> to the patient—to
overcome disease by a well-directed onset of <em>heroic</em> remedies—and
it has been a secondary object altogether to guard
against doing him harm. But medical practice is becoming
reversed in this respect. It may at the present time be
said of quite a large proportion of the profession, that it is
the principal object of the physician to avoid doing harm
to the patient, and to prevent harm from being done to him
by himself and by his friends: and then, after looking well
to this object, he is ready to do whatever positive good he
sees can be done in the case. Accordingly, cautionary and
quieting measures, intended to remove the obstacles which
may hinder the operation of the curative power of nature,
are getting to predominate in medical treatment over the
more active and direct measures for overcoming disease.
‘The golden axiom of Chomel, that it is only the <em>second</em>
law of therapeutics <em>to do good</em>, its <em>first</em> law being this—<em>not
to do harm</em>—is gradually finding its way into the medical
mind, preventing an incalculable amount of positive ill.’
So remarks Dr. Bartlett in a work,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> which I deem to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
one of the best and most effectual efforts, which have been
made in promoting the revolution, which is now taking place
in the practice of medicine. It is a work which, if I mistake
not, is to exert a thorough and extensive influence upon
the interests of medical science.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude this chapter without paying a passing
tribute to the memory of one, my preceptor and friend, who
stood among the foremost in the work of reform now going
on in the medical profession. I refer to the late Dr. Hale,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
of Boston. He was eminently a man of accurate observation.
His enquiry always was after the <em>facts</em>. He asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
not what a man <em>supposed</em>, but what he had <em>observed</em>—not
what he <em>thought</em>, but what he had <em>found to be true</em>. His
valuable contributions to the recorded experience, and the
literature of the profession, bear him witness on this point.
His labors, so deservedly prized by his brethren, are ended,
but we have reason to rejoice, that he has left behind him
so many of a like spirit, who are endeavoring to redeem our
science from the dominion of fanciful theory and loose reasoning,
and to place it under the control of a true and rigid
<span class="allsmcap">OBSERVATION</span>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> The reader will permit the author to gratify his own feelings of regard
for Dr. Hale as a <em>man</em>, as well as a physician, by inserting here the following
extract from the memoir of him, from the pen of Dr. Channing. “Dr.
Hale was an honest man. He was honest in sentiment and in purpose.
He had little or no tolerance for what he thought unfair; and any believed
misuse or abuse of trusts he resolutely opposed, however active or however
strong was the agency by which the wrong was attempted to be consummated.
These were not the elements of popularity. You could hardly
make a very popular man out of such. But for the honor and exceeding
praise of humanity, there are men who have found something better worth
living for than the present fame—men who are happy and satisfied to do
that which may live after them, and the memory and the use of which can
only be for good. Dr. Hale enjoyed life—the best thank-offering for living.
He was social and hospitable, for he would contribute to the pleasure of
others, as well as his own. He was always cheerful, because he was truly
hopeful. He looked on the bright side of disease in himself and in others;
and if he labored so well for their recovery, he never questioned his own.</p>

<p>Dr. Hale was a religious man. In the development of the religious sentiment
was his power. It was kept active by habitual, daily devotion. It
influenced his whole life, making him an earnest student and a faithful practitioner—giving
him strong interest in all wise effort to extend Christianity
in distant lands, and by his example recommending to others the religious
life. In his religion was his benevolence, which with very narrow fortune
led him to attempt and to accomplish most important objects. In this was
his cheerfulness in suffering and all trial; and out of his religion came the
peace and the hope of his death hour.”</p>

<span class="fs80">POPULAR ESTIMATES OF PHYSICIANS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There is no class of men whose talents and attainments
are so erroneously estimated by the public as are those of
physicians. Some of the causes of this erroneous estimate
have been brought to view in the chapters on the Uncertainty
of Medicine, and on Good and Bad Practice. I propose
in this chapter to treat of this subject more distinctly,
to point out some other causes operating with those which
I have already mentioned, to show the results of this false
estimate of medical character and attainments, and to
develope some plain principles, on which a correct estimate
may for the most part be secured.</p>

<p>I presume it is sufficiently clear to the reader, from the
views which I have before presented, that the community
cannot judge with any degree of correctness <em>directly</em>, of the
practice of physicians,—either of the truth of the principles
on which it is based, or of its actual results.</p>

<p>How then shall the community judge of physicians?
This question I will endeavor to answer.</p>

<p>The view which I gave, in the first chapter, of the uncertainty
of medicine, I trust, made it obvious to the reader,
that a thorough education is pre-eminently necessary to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
proper practice of the medical art. In endeavoring therefore
to form an estimate of the qualifications of any
physician, let the evidence of his having obtained such an
education be well considered.</p>

<p>But what is this evidence? Is it to be found in the bare
fact that he has a diploma, obtained from some respectable
medical institution? While a diploma is worth something
as evidence, as there must be some improvement of the
means of education, in order to pass the examination
requisite to obtain it; yet it must necessarily be defective
evidence. That the truth may be more fully ascertained,
let the inquiry be made, how far the physician has improved
the advantages he has had; for it must be remembered,
that it is especially true of medicine, that a diligent and
wise use of limited opportunities will impart more
knowledge and skill, than can be acquired by a careless and
unwise use of the most extensive advantages afforded by
the profession.</p>

<p>I will allow that there are difficulties in the way of
arriving at the truth in this inquiry, and the public are often
most grossly deceived by the parade which is made by some
physicians, in regard to the opportunities which they have
enjoyed. Still, I apprehend, that the erroneous judgment
of the public in regard to such cases, arises from a too
ready confidence in mere pretensions, and that it can be
avoided for the most part by a little more pains-taking in
making the inquiry, and by applying tests of another
character, to which I shall soon allude.</p>

<p>But education in the science of medicine is practically
despised by quite a large portion of the community.
Though this sentiment is not often distinctly avowed, yet
it exists to a greater extent than is generally supposed. It
shows itself in an indifference to the true evidences of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
physician’s qualifications, and in a readiness to put the
quack on a level with the thoroughly-educated physician,
or even above him. These indications of the prevalence
of this sentiment, are not confined to the ignorant; but
they often appear among the well informed, and even the
learned.</p>

<p>Sometimes this sentiment is boldly avowed in language
like the following: ‘I care little about the evidence of a
physician’s having had an education. The fact that he is
successful in treating disease is worth vastly more than a
piece of parchment. Many a man has risen to eminence
in other professions by his own exertions, without any great
amount of education; and why should not this be the case
in the practice of medicine? There was Franklin, who
rose by his own efforts to a post of honor and usefulness
far above multitudes of his cotemporaries, who had a most
finished education; and why should there not be Franklins
in medicine, as well as in other departments of knowledge?’</p>

<p>The assertion, that success in curing disease is worth
more than a piece of parchment, is strictly true. But the
evidences, on which a correct estimate of success can be
formed, are not ordinarily, as the reader has seen in the
chapter on Good and Bad Practice, within the reach of the
community; and the attempts which it makes to form an
estimate from the defective evidence at its command, often
result in the bestowment of the praise due to success upon
those who are really unsuccessful.</p>

<p>As to the use which is made of so great a name as that
of Franklin to justify a disregard of education in medicine,
I remark, that those who hold such language forget three
very plain truths. 1st. That self-education is, after all that
can be said, education. It is education acquired in spite of
difficulties, and without the aids which men usually have.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
2d. That education thus obtained indicates the possession
of <em>uncommon</em> power of mind. There are but few Franklins
in any profession. It is not common for men to rise to
eminence with the small means which he enjoyed, and in
face of the difficulties which he encountered. 3d. That
Franklin, and all those men who have thus risen to
eminence, so far from despising education, made most
diligent use of all the means of education which they could
command, aspiring all the time to higher and higher
advantages; and while they lamented the deficiencies of
their own early training, they labored most assiduously to
give to others the most extensive means of acquiring
knowledge. Very different from this, I cannot avoid
remarking in this connexion, is the spirit of those pretenders
in medicine, who affect to despise education, and who claim
that they have an innate skill, which education can neither
impart nor improve.</p>

<p>I shall in another chapter maintain, that it is both the
duty and the interest of the community, to demand that
there shall be a respectable standard of education in the
medical profession, and will therefore dismiss this topic for
the present.</p>

<p>The second source of evidence, in regard to the qualifications
of a physician, is to be found in the unbiassed
opinion of his medical brethren. I allow that there are
difficulties in the way of obtaining such an opinion.
There is, on the one hand, the prejudice of rivalry, and, on
the other, the partiality arising from mutual interest.
Sometimes these influences extend beyond the individual,
and arrange medical men in small parties, or cliques; and
these often render it exceedingly difficult to discover the
standing which any physician has among his brethren.
Yet it is true, that every physician has a general estimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
put upon him by the profession, <em>and it is commonly a
correct one</em>. And this estimate can ordinarily be ascertained
by any one, who makes due allowance for the
influences to which I have alluded.</p>

<p>While this strictly professional reputation, which is
awarded to every physician by his brethren, is commonly
very nearly correspondent with his true merits, that which
the public awards to him may be far otherwise. It is often
the case, that, while a physician, of whom his brethren have
an exalted opinion, meets with but little favor from the
community; another, who is a very ordinary practitioner,
and who is so considered by the profession at large, has an
extensive practice, and a high popular reputation. Such a
physician may be treated with much outward deference by
his medical brethren, on account of the position in which
the public favor has placed him; and this is often very
erroneously considered as evidence, that he is held in great
estimation by the members of the profession generally.</p>

<p>I pass now to the consideration of a means of estimating
the qualifications of physicians, which is of a more
practical character, and more certain in its results, than
those which I have already mentioned. And yet it is one
which has been very generally neglected, for reasons which
I shall give in a future stage of my remarks.</p>

<p>There are certain mental qualities, which are essential
to the possession of skill in the practice of medicine.
Whoever is found to possess these qualities, you may be
sure, will with proper education make a good physician.
And if they are wanting in any one, no education, nor
experience can supply the deficiency. He never can be
truly skilful as a physician; and if such an one acquire a
reputation for skill, which is no uncommon thing, all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
we can say is, that the public are deceived in their estimate
of his qualifications.</p>

<p>How then can an intelligent man discover, whether
a physician has these requisite mental qualities, and to
what extent he has them? What tests can he apply to
bring them out, so that he can see them distinctly, and
measure them with any good degree of accuracy?</p>

<p>The science of medicine is so much a mystery to the
common observer, that he cannot, as you have already seen,
apply his tests to a direct examination of the physician’s
knowledge. He is not competent to make the estimate in
this way; and if he is not aware of this, he will certainly
be deceived. If he wishes effectually to avoid error, he
must apply a touchstone which he himself understands, and
not one of which he is profoundly ignorant. What is this
touchstone? Plainly this. <em>Let him observe the mental
qualities of the physician, as they are exhibited in regard
to any subject, with which he is himself familiar in common
with the physician</em>; and he has here a test upon which he
may rely with absolute certainty. He discovers in this
way the character of the physician’s mind; and it is just to
infer that the mental qualities thus laid open to view, stamp
their impress upon the practice of his profession, and give
to it its character. No change comes over his mind when
he passes from other subjects to that of medicine. The
same mental powers are there, and he will observe, think
reason, and act, just as you have seen him do in regard to
common subjects.</p>

<p>Take an illustration from surgery. You see a surgeon
set a fractured limb. You cannot judge whether he does it
skilfully, because you do not understand how it should be
done, so as to bring the broken ends accurately together,
and keep them so. But if that surgeon, in passing your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
house, by some accident breaks the thill of his carriage, you
can watch him as he splices the thill, and you can judge,
for you are competent to do so, whether he exhibits mechanical
talent in the operation. If he does, you can safely
infer that the same mechanical talent will be brought into
exercise in setting a bone, and that he will set it as skilfully
as he spliced the thill. Other talents in a medical man can
be tested in a similar manner.</p>

<p>The truth, of which I have given this single illustration,
is so obvious when plainly stated that it hardly needs to be
dwelt upon at all; and yet, it is so often disregarded by the
community, in the estimates which are made of physicians,
that it may be profitable to illustrate it somewhat at large.
In doing this we shall accomplish another important purpose—we
shall obtain a clear view of those qualities which
are most necessary in the particular calling of a physician.</p>

<p>Let us then cursorily notice some prominent characteristics,
as they are seen in physicians in your daily intercourse
with them on common subjects, and apply the criterion
which we have under consideration.</p>

<p>Look at the mode in which physicians form their opinions.</p>

<p>You discover in your conversations with a physician
upon politics, religion, or the occurrences of the day, that
he is very credulous. Have you a doubt that the same
credulity follows him into a sick room, and mars the accuracy
of his observations of disease and of the influence
of remedies? And so, on the other hand, the physician
who shows a sceptical cast of mind on other subjects, will
assuredly be a doubter on a subject clothed with so much
uncertainty as medicine is, and his treatment of disease will
be marked by hesitation and lack of energy and firmness.</p>

<p>You see a physician apt to form his opinions on ordinary
subjects hastily. Slight evidence satisfies him, and he makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
up his mind at once. It may be that he does it with so much
shrewdness that he is very apt to be right in his conclusions;
but sometimes he is entirely wrong, because he has
in his haste overlooked some apparently slight circumstances
which are really of vital importance. There is quite a large
class of such minds in the medical profession. They are
better fitted to practice in acute forms of disease than in
chronic cases. These latter require patient investigation
to thread out all their intricate complications.</p>

<p>I once knew two physicians of considerable eminence,
who had directly opposite casts of mind, in regard to the
qualities to which I have just alluded. They lived and
practised in the same neighborhood through a long life.
The one would spend perhaps an hour in ferreting out all
the hidden labyrinths of a chronic case, and I have often
been delighted, as he would clearly and in choicest language
unfold his views, after he had concluded his examination.
The other never wanted more than a few minutes to learn
all he wished to know of a case, and he was prepared to
act. Possessed of much native shrewdness, it was astonishing
to see how he would avoid error in forming his hasty
opinions. He seemed to be aware in what his forte lay.
He had an abhorrence of all long and intricate cases, and
turned them over, so far as he could, to his brethren; and
he took peculiar pleasure in managing acute cases, in which
the changes were rapid, and the end either for good or ill
came soon.</p>

<p>You discover in your conversations with one physician
on common subjects, that he is very slow and cautious in
adopting opinions, and when he has once adopted them he
adheres to them with great tenacity; while another, on the
contrary, is exceedingly changeable in his opinions. These
opposite qualities, exhibited as they are abroad in society,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
go with them to the sick chamber, and they exert their full
influence. The one will fix upon a course of practice in a
given case with all due consideration, and when he has
once fixed upon it, he will pursue it most faithfully, even
though the progress of the case may furnish conclusive evidence
that he is wrong. He will be blind to that evidence,
because he believes most assuredly that he is right in his
views of the case. The other will not pursue a course
long enough to determine whether it be right, but will see
continual reasons for change; and his course from the beginning
to the end of a case will often present a medley of
variations, from which no intelligent conclusions can be
drawn. The one will have a few favorite remedies, which
he reckons as old and tried friends, and he adds but few to
the little group from year to year. The other will make
frequent changes in the remedies which he employs, and
will try in rapid succession the new medicines, which every
fresh periodical bring to his notice.</p>

<p>Some men take strong views of everything which they see.
They must always have an opinion, whether the evidence
upon which it is based be sufficient or not; and that opinion
fills the mind, and actuates all the conduct. They are
apt to have very partial and exclusive views, overlooking
in their ardor points, which, though they may have little
apparent prominence, may, if properly examined, lead to
discoveries of great importance. Such men in the medical
profession always make a decided impression upon the public
mind, and have many strong and ardent friends; and if
they possess considerable talent, they generally acquire a
dazzling reputation. It is true that they commit frequent
and often great errors. But when their bold opinions turn
out to be correct, it adds wonderfully to their reputation
for acuteness and wisdom, while their errors are mostly concealed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
and the whisper that tells of those errors that chance
to be discovered, is effectually drowned in the noisy commendation
of their enthusiastic adherents.</p>

<p>If I at all succeeded in my object in the chapter on the
Uncertainty of Medicine, the reader was convinced that
there is no pursuit in which a habit of accurate observation
is more needed than in the practice of the medical art.</p>

<p>How then can a common observer test a physician in
regard to this talent? If the observer were himself a physician,
he could do this by watching him in his examinations
of cases of disease. But as he is not, and is therefore
ignorant of the subjects to be examined, he will fail in any
attempt of this kind. He will be apt to commit, for example,
this error. He sees that a physician makes a great
many inquiries of his patients in regard to their complaints,
and he may for this reason alone conclude that he is a nice
observer. This minuteness of examination often gives a
physician very unjustly this reputation; and in fact it is
one of the most common tricks of the trade. There is often
a great parade of questioning with very little true observation.
A physician who is a skilful observer will learn more
of a patient’s condition, by watching him as he lies in bed,
and making a few inquiries, than another will by a multitude
of questions; just as one man, who scarcely appears to
look at anything as he passes through a street, may really
observe and know more about the various objects in that
street, than another man, who appears with eyes wide open
to look at everything. A mere glance will sometimes reveal
to the skilful observer the true nature of the case, when
the unskilful have not been able to discover it with the
most diligent examination of the symptoms. I will mention
a single example. A man who was severely sick was attended
by two physicians, who were somewhat at a loss in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
regard to the nature of his disease. Another physician,
who was called in, before asking a single question, suspected
from the posture of the patient that he had a hernia, in
common language a rupture; and on examination this was
found to be the case.</p>

<p>I might mention some other errors, to which the inquirer
would be liable, if he attempted to judge directly of the
physician’s mode of examining disease, but it is not necessary.</p>

<p>How then, the question recurs, shall he test the physician
on the point under consideration?</p>

<p>Let him see how the physician observes in regard to
some subject, with which he himself is acquainted. He will
discover in this way what his habits of observation are;
and he may be sure, that these same habits mark his investigations
of disease in the chamber of the sick. No man
has different habits of observation for different subjects.</p>

<p>Suppose that you have a curious article in your possession,
and you have become acquainted with all the facts in
regard to it. If you show it to several physicians, and
observe the inquiries which they make in relation to it, you
can discover the different characters of their minds, and
may thus know how they observe and investigate disease.</p>

<p>One of them asks perhaps but few questions, and some
of those are irrelevant. He discovers but little in regard
to the article, and you may be sure that he will never discover
but little in regard to disease.</p>

<p>Another, after making a few inquiries, starts some supposition
or theory, and this directs all his future inquiries.
He of course obtains a very partial knowledge of the facts,
and this is mingled with errors. And so it is with him in
his investigation of medical subjects. He is a theorizing
practitioner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>Another makes many inquiries, but they are of a rambling
character. He finds out many of the facts in regard
to the article, but by no means all of them. His observation
is active, but it is without method and incomplete.
Though he will be diligent in the investigation of disease,
and will appear to most persons to be an acute and skilful
observer, he never will obtain a thorough and complete
knowledge of any case.</p>

<p>Another, by a natural succession of inquiries, discovers
one fact after another, till he knows the whole. He does
not ask a single irrelevant question. The answer to every
question either developes a new fact, or confirms one already
discovered. He separates accurately the probable from the
true, wholly rejecting the merely plausible. He frames no
theory. His search is only for facts. You may be sure
that he will be a skilful observer in the sick room, and that
in the investigation of disease he will be constantly adding
to his store of valuable and well-arranged facts.</p>

<p>Do you wish to ascertain what characterizes a physician’s
<em>measures</em> in the treatment of disease? Instead of watching
his practice, of which, as you have seen, you cannot
judge with any good degree of correctness, observe what
measures he proposes when acting, not in the capacity of a
physician, but in that of a citizen, a neighbor, a member of
an association, and what reasons he gives for these measures.
If you find that he advocates measures which show
common sense, shrewdness, and good judgment, and which
accomplish the purpose aimed at; you may safely conclude
that the same common sense, shrewdness and good judgment
mark his treatment of his patients, and that he is a skilful
and successful practitioner of medicine.</p>

<p>A very little thing will sometimes develope some characteristic
of a physician’s measures. A physician, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
starts his horse to leave you after a pleasant chat, finds the
rein caught under some part of the harness. He pulls it up
to disengage it; but, as he does not succeed, he gives it a
twitch in which he succeeds no better. His face reddens,
and he twitches again and again, each time more violently,
and finally, by tearing out a loop in his harness, he disengages
the rein. You may safely infer that that physician
will be apt to have just such twitching measures in his
treatment of the sick, and will in this way mar some things
which are of some more importance than the loops in his
harness.</p>

<p>It is quite a prevalent idea in the community, that a man
may be an ignoramus in regard to other subjects, and yet
may have great skill in medicine. It is supposed that there
is in the healing art a sort of mysterious tact or skill, innate
in the man, and not acquired like other knowledge. It is
this idea which gives such a reputation, for infallibility
almost, to the natural bone-setter. We find here, also, the
reason that intemperance in a physician so little impairs
the confidence of his employers. It must be obvious that
in no employment is a steady and clear state of mind more
needed; and the obscurity of mind and recklessness, which
intoxication, even when existing only in a slight degree,
invariably produces, must unfit the physician for the proper
performance of his duties. And yet how many sensible
people, who would fear to trust an intemperate stage-driver
or engineer, will unhesitatingly commit their health and
life to the care of an intemperate physician, because they
suppose that he has a peculiar skill, of which even intoxication
cannot deprive him. His drunkenness seems to act
as a dark background, making his skill appear the brighter
by contrast.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>In confirmation of this idea of the possession of innate
skill, it is said that a man may be a fool on one subject, and
yet may be a genius on another. A man may be, for instance,
a great arithmetician, or a very ingenious mechanic,
and may yet exhibit folly on most other subjects. This
may be true in some few instances, but it is not at all common;
and rare cases never can establish a general rule or
principle. And besides, a genius in medicine, if he be a
mere genius, in the popular sense of the term, makes but a
poor practitioner. For true skill in the practice of medicine
requires the possession of a wide range of talents, and
among these sound judgment, or, (as it is familiarly called
when used in reference to ordinary subjects,) common
sense, is pre-eminent. This is a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i> in the physician.
The most brilliant talents cannot make one a good
practitioner without this qualification. They may make
him an interesting lecturer, or writer, and may give him a
high reputation in the community. But his lack of this
practical talent must render him unsuccessful in the treatment
of disease, and the lectures which he may give will
be deficient in practical instruction, and the books which
he may write will add nothing to that storehouse of facts,
which come only from observation, guided by a discriminating
judgment, and plain common sense. He may construct
beautiful theories, and explain and defend them with ingenuity,
but he never can be a reliable source of instruction
and information to his medical brethren.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>The reader has seen that there are then <em>five</em> ways of
judging of the skill and the attainments of a physician.
1st. By examining his opinions on medical subjects, and
the reasons upon which they are based. 2d. By observing
his practice, and comparing its results with those of the
practice of others. 3d. By inquiring into the evidences
of his education. 4th. By observing the unbiassed opinions
entertained of him by his medical brethren. 5th. By
observing his mental qualities as they are exhibited in relation
to those subjects which the observer himself understands.</p>

<p>If the inquirer be a physician, he can very properly
make use of the two first-named means of arriving at the
estimate. But if he be a non-professional observer, he
must for the most part give up these means, as being liable
to lead him into error, and resort to the remaining ones.
That he should <em>entirely</em> give up the two first means I do not
claim. All that I claim is, that he should place very little
reliance upon them, while his chief reliance should be upon
the three last.</p>

<p>If intelligent men would adopt the course which I have
indicated, in their attempt to estimate the professional merits
of physicians, they would for the most part avoid the
errors which they now so frequently commit. But, as it
now is, they very generally form their judgment from a
direct observation of medical practice, and from the reports
which their friends and acquaintances give of their observations;
and they make but slight use of those means of
judging, which I have shown to be the least liable to error.
And I fear that they will be slow to change in this respect,
for the simple reason, that they will be slow to admit their
incompetence to sit in judgment on modes of treating
disease. Dr. Beddoes, an eminent English physician, once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
remarked, that “there are three things which almost every
person gives himself credit for understanding, whether he
has taken any pains to make himself master of them or not,
These are: 1. The art of mending a dull fire: 2. Politics:
and 3. <span class="smcap">Physic</span>.” And this is especially true of the last of
these. Both the well informed and the ignorant seem to
think, that they are perfectly competent to decide whether
a physician is treating a case properly; and watch the
effect of remedies in order to do this, and hesitate not to
express their opinions on this point in the most positive
manner. So common and inveterate is this habit in the
community, that it will be difficult to eradicate it. And
yet I think it can in some good degree be done. Intelligent
men can be made to see, by a candid exposition of the
peculiar liability there is in medical experience to mistake
in regard to the relation between cause and effect, that it
requires an extensive knowledge of medicine to make accurate
observations of the influence of remedies; and that
therefore one who has never studied this science, and who
has had but limited means of observation, must be but a
poor critic on the practice of physicians. They can see
that, though such an one may cope with others in the art
of mending a dull fire, or on the subject of politics, yet on
so abstruse a subject as medicine is, he ought to be somewhat
modest in his opinions, and not put them forth, as is
now so often done, with all the authority of an oracle.</p>

<p>Why then, let me ask, have not intelligent men been
made to look upon this subject in this light? This question
I will endeavor to answer.</p>

<p>There is, in the first place, a large class in the medical
profession, who desire no change in the views of the community,
but prefer to maintain their present false position.
Their success, like that of the quack, actually depends on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
practising upon the credulity of the public. They would
dread being scrutinized in the way which I have pointed
out, by tests which the observer himself understands. They
would prefer that people should continue to judge of them
as they have done, by tests of which they are ignorant,
because they can in this way continue to deceive them.
The number of such men in our profession, I am sorry to
say, is very large; and many of them have an extensive
practice, and stand high in the public favor, and for this
reason are quite indifferent both to their own standing with
their brethren, and to the general standing of the profession
itself. Though they do nothing perhaps which is sufficient
to endanger their loss of caste among physicians, their
influence is detrimental to the interests of the profession,
and favors in the worst possible way the hold of quackery
upon the community.</p>

<p>There is another large class of medical men, who really
desire to be honorable in their course, but who have felt
themselves obliged to use to some extent the same arts
with which the dishonorable impose upon their patients.
They feel that they cannot reform public sentiment, but
must take it as it is, and do the best they can with it. They
find whims and caprices and false ideas among the intelligent,
as well as the ignorant; and instead of taking any
pains to correct the evil, they succumb to it, and set themselves
to work to make capital out of it. They thus
place themselves on common ground with the quack and
the pretender, and subject themselves to be estimated by
the same false rules which are applied to them. They thus
have almost insensibly contracted habits of low cunning
and shallow pretension; and these are habits which are not
easily given up. Of course this class of medical men will
be inclined to look with distrust upon any efforts to reform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
the profession, and the public, in the particulars to which I
have alluded; and, though they may not actually oppose
such efforts, or may from selfish motives even make a show
of favoring them in certain quarters, they cannot be expected
to give them any active support.</p>

<p>There is, however, one result of the course which this
class of medical men have pursued, which seems to be opening
the eyes of the most honorable among them, and which
promises to bring them out from their false and degrading
position. They find that their cunning subservience to the
false opinions of the people, has increased the hold of those
opinions upon the public mind; and, as a wide door has thus
been opened for quackery, they find that the same arts, in
using which they have been so successful, are now used
quite as dexterously by the whole herd of ignorant quacks
and showy pretenders. They find that the Homœpathist
is stealing away some of their best, and, as they thought,
their most reliable patients. The Thompsonian, the Chrono-thermalist,
&amp;c., are committing similar depredations. And
of all this they have no right to complain, because these
pretenders obtain these patients by the same artful and deceptive
means, by which these physicians at first acquired
them, and by which they have so long retained them among
their patrons.</p>

<p>The result which I have pointed out is an accumulated
result. The community are running wild now after various
systems and modes of practice, and the public mind is
all afloat, carried about by every wind of doctrine in medicine.
It is now the hey-dey of quackery of all kinds and
degrees. The causes of the great prevalence of this evil
are not temporary and recent, but they have been acting
for a long time, and we now see the accumulated result.
Among the chief of these causes is the course which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
been pursued by a large portion of the medical profession.
The profession itself has given birth to much of the quackery
of the present day.</p>

<p>The evil of this comes upon the profession generally, but
more particularly and grievously upon the class of physicians
of which I have just been speaking. The first class
which I mentioned are not as much affected, because, being
less scrupulous, they have a wider range of arts to be used;
and the mortifications to which they are subjected in their
competition with quacks are more easily borne, because
they have less of honor and conscience to trouble them in
relation to their course. While this class will be utterly
opposed to any attempts at reform, the second class of which
I have spoken, seeing their false position, and beginning to
suffer some of its vexatious results, will probably experience
a sifting process, whenever efforts at reform shall be thoroughly
entered upon. The least honorable, and those
whose habits of imposition (for such they must be termed),
have become fixed, will join the first class, giving up all
scruple, and adopting in full the measures of the quack and
charlatan. But I am persuaded, that the largest portion of
this class of practitioners have so much of honor and conscience,
that, whenever a general effort shall be made to
redeem the profession from its false position before the community,
they will be ready to unite in that effort.</p>

<p>But this effort is not to begin in this class. There is
still another class of physicians who are to originate it.
They are the men in our profession who have always pursued
an honorable course, and have never yielded to the
temptations to use the arts of empiricism, however strong
they may have been—who, though they have often seen
their brethren use such arts successfully in their competition
with them without injuring their standing in the community,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
have never allowed such mortifications to induce
them to swerve from the path of honor and duty. Efforts,
it is true, have been made by such physicians to enlighten
the public mind in relation to its false estimates of professional
merit; but they have been for the most part isolated
and individual efforts, and they have soon been given up
for reasons to which I have before alluded. A general and
united effort is needed, and I have no doubt that it would
be successful.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">[34]</a> We had some years ago, says Dr. Rush in one of his lectures, a physician
in this city of sprightly talents, who was an habitual drunkard. Soon
after his death, I was called to attend a gentleman who had been one of
his constant patients. He submitted with reluctance to my prescriptions,
because they were contrary to the modes of practice of his former physician,
to whom he was so much attached, that he declared he would
rather be prescribed for by him when drunk, than by any sober physician

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br>
<span class="fs80">MEANS OF REMOVING QUACKERY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It must be obvious to any one who observes the wide
influence which quackery maintains in its various forms
in the community, amid all the efforts which are made to
overthrow it, that there has as yet been discovered no adequate
remedy for this evil. It is common for physicians to
say that there is no remedy—that there is, and always will
be, a class of persons who must, from the very character
of their minds, be addicted to quackery; and that it is of
no avail to attempt to deliver them from their errors, but
they must be left to go from one delusion to another, as
they choose, all their lives. If quackery were confined to
such persons, it would, I allow, be idle to talk of any remedy.
But it is not so confined. We every day see men,
who are intelligent and judicious on other subjects, perfectly
deceived and captivated with the false pretensions of
empiricism. If these individuals were ignorant, and were
easily influenced by merely plausible reasoning, or were
enthusiastic, or over fond of novelty and change, then 1
should despair of making any impression upon them. But
as this is not the case, I am led to the conclusion, that there
must be some defects in the <em>mode</em> in which truth on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
subject of medicine has been presented to their minds; and
that the sources of error have not been so plainly revealed
to their view in this, as they have been in other fields of
enquiry.</p>

<p>Efforts, it is true, have been made by the medical profession
to correct the tendency to empiricism, which is so
rife in the community. But I believe that it can be satisfactorily
shown that these efforts have, to a great extent,
been made with wrong means, and in a wrong direction;
and that for this reason they have failed to strike at the root
of the evil.</p>

<p>Much reliance has been placed upon giving to the people
a knowledge of anatomy, physiology, dietetics, &amp;c. For
this purpose books have been published, journals of health
have been issued, and lectures have been delivered. All
this is very well. Valuable information has thus been communicated.
Still, it leaves the great sources of empiricism
nearly, if not quite, untouched. These are pouring forth
their destructive streams more abundantly than ever, notwithstanding
the great increase of late of popular knowledge
on medical subjects.</p>

<p>And this is as we should expect it would be from the
nature of the case. For the knowledge, which one obtains
from popular books and lectures, of the human system as a
piece of mechanism, can have but little influence upon his
notions in regard to the operation of remedies, on that system;
for the operation of remedies, for the most part, lies
beyond the mere mechanical principles of the organization,
and therefore cannot be materially elucidated by a knowledge
of those principles. For example, the knowledge, which
the dyspeptic gains, from popular instruction, of the situation
and the shape of the stomach, of the number of its coats,
and of the process of digestion, cannot enlighten him in regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
to the treatment of his disease, and will therefore not
guard him against delusion on this subject. He will be just
as ready, as he was before he acquired this knowledge, to take
some patent medicine, or to resort to some boasting empiric.</p>

<p>None of the common popular errors can be removed by
the knowledge referred to. If a man should adopt the notion,
that the blood is the seat of all disease, and therefore
that remedies relieve disease by purifying the blood, would
it be possible to dislodge that error, simply by showing him
the heart, and describing to him minutely the circulation?
The mechanical contrivances of this beautiful and wonderful
piece of machinery have manifestly no reference to the
state of the blood contained in it. How can he know, from
an examination of the heart and the arteries and the veins,
whether he is right in attributing all disease to a corrupt
state of the life-giving fluid? Or what light will this examination
give him in relation to the remedies which he supposes
enter the circulation and rectify the blood, by neutralizing
whatever it contains which is bad?</p>

<p>I will even take a case in which one would suppose that
a knowledge of the mechanical structure of the body would
be of essential service, as an antidote to quackery. I refer
to a belief in the skill of the natural bone-setter. How
often does the knowledge referred to entirely fail to dislodge
this error. You may show the believer in it the structure
of the joints, and demonstrate to him by a clearness of proof
which would satisfy him on any other subject, that it is as
necessary to understand this structure, as it is any other
piece of mechanism, in order to be skilful in detecting the
nature of the injuries which it receives, and in repairing
them. And yet, he will reply, ‘all this looks right, to be
sure; but still here is the fact that the bone-setter does set
bones some how or other.’ You will have to do something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
more, to convince him that his confidence is misplaced. You
must show him, how it is that the ignorant bone-setter acquires
a reputation, in spite of his ignorance, and his consequent
blunders. And this can be done by facts. In
commenting on these facts you can make use of the knowledge,
which your friend may have of anatomy, as an auxiliary
in pressing your point; and it may thus prove of great
service, though it is wholly unavailing when appealed to
alone. For a full view of this subject I refer the reader to
the chapter on Natural Bone-Setters.</p>

<p>While a popular knowledge of anatomy and physiology
has but little influence in restraining quackery, it sometimes
evidently increases it, by giving its possessor an exalted
idea of his medical acumen. He upon whom it has had
this effect is much disposed to adopt opinions and theories
on slight and plausible grounds, and in this way is constantly
led into error. The physician meets persons of this
character every day. They are always ready to talk with
him, and they seem to feel quite at home on medical subjects,
and some of them have really acquired considerable information
on these subjects; but they have built upon it a superstructure
of untenable theories and notions, and they are commonly
carried about by every wind of doctrine in medicine.</p>

<p>The quack aware of the prevalence of this superficial
knowledge of medicine, gathered from popular books and
lectures, often makes provision for the taste thus engendered.
He hires some one, perhaps a medical student, to
prepare for him a disquisition on some of the principles of
medical science, which is to accompany the certificates
setting forth the virtues of his nostrums. This disquisition
may all be correct, though it is more commonly a mixture
of truth and fallacy, so combined, that the superficial reader
does not separate the one from the other. It answers the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
purpose for which it is intended. It convinces most people
who read it, that the author (whom they suppose to be the
proprietor of the medicines) really has a great knowledge
of medical science, and that, therefore, though other patent
medicines may be impositions, his cannot be. There is
often in these disquisitions page after page of physiological
discussions, in learned guise, which have no sort of bearing
upon the nature of the medicines recommended, though
they do have most manifestly upon their <em>sale</em>, as the result
shows.</p>

<p>Let me not be understood to mean, that none but physicians
ought to know anything about the human system;
nor that the knowledge of it, which is obtained from popular
books and lectures, can be of no advantage in the warfare
with empiricism. Though, when it is relied upon as
the chief, almost the only, weapon in this warfare, it is, as
you have seen, of little avail, and is often even turned
against the cause of truth and science; yet, as an <em>adjuvant</em>
to other means in removing quackery, it may prove very valuable.
What then, let us enquire, are those other means?</p>

<p>I have shown in another chapter, that the principal popular
errors in medicine arise from partial views of the operations
of disease and the effects of remedies, and are false
conclusions in regard to the relation of cause and effect.
These false conclusions are, as you have seen, the basis of
quackery; and therefore one of the chief means of removing
quackery is to be found in the exposure of the fallacy
of these conclusions.</p>

<p>But it will perhaps be said, that this has often been
attempted, and with so slight success, that there is very little
encouragement for repeating such attempts; and that it is
best on the whole to let the community find out their errors
by their own experience, sad as it sometimes is. Those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
who take this ground assume, that the efforts which have
been made for this object have been of a proper character.
I think it to be clear that they have ordinarily not been so.
There has been too much of ridicule and sarcasm. These
are means which are appropriate to a certain extent, as
auxiliaries to sober argument; but they never should be
relied upon, as the only, or the chief, instruments in combatting
error. There has also been too much of denunciation,
and calling of hard names. There has not been, on
the other hand, enough of calm, candid and patient discussion
on the part of physicians with the well-informed, as
they meet them from day to day. To the medical man
quackery appears so nonsensical, that he has commonly no
patience with those who embrace it. He does not remember
that many of his own profession have, in their reasonings
about cause and effect, committed some of the very
same errors which have engendered that quackery. Perhaps,
if he looks back upon his own course, he may find
that he himself has at some time fallen into an error, which
might have led him into empiricism, if he had been out of
the profession, but which was prevented from producing
this effect upon him by that sense of dignity, which characterizes
the man of science, and by that disposition to
careful scrutiny, which the pursuit of medical science is
peculiarly apt to impart. He should therefore avoid being
betrayed, by the ridiculousness of quackery, into the utterance
of harsh expressions, or into too free an use of sarcasm.
He should, on the contrary, endeavor to show any intelligent
friend, who has chanced in some way to be deluded
by empiricism, that he has been deceived, and point out to
him just how it has been done. He should show him what
the mistakes are which he has made, in relation to the connexion
between cause and effect; and should endeavor to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
impress upon his mind the truth, that there is more necessity
for cautious discrimination, in forming conclusions on
this, than on any other subject in the wide range of science.
He should show him how common it is in medicine, to
attribute results to causes, which have had no agency in
producing them; and that if physicians themselves are apt
to commit this error, much more must they be, who are
ignorant of medical subjects, and who have but limited
means of observation.</p>

<p>It is this individual influence, which may thus be exerted
by the profession, that must be relied upon as one of the
principal means of ridding the public of the evils of
quackery. It is not a mere occasional effort—some address,
some short article in a public journal, some fling of biting
sarcasm, or some sally of wit—that will do it. Men of
strong sense and good judgment, when they are led into
error, as such men often are on the subject of medicine, are
not to be delivered from that error by such means. Remedies
of a more searching character, and a treatment more
patient, thorough, and persevering, are required to reach
their case.</p>

<p>It is very desirable that this individual influence be exerted
by medical men, because the class of persons to whom
I have alluded, and who may be successfully reached by it,
are the chief pillars of empiricism. It is true, I will allow,
that the ignorant, the enthusiastic, and the novelty-seeking,
make up the great mass of the patrons of quackery; but
they are kept in countenance by those men of acknowledged
good sense, who are found in considerable numbers in
every community, supporting empiricism in some of its
many forms by the weight of their example. The plain
unlettered man who takes some patent medicine, is encouraged
to do so by the example of some neighbor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
general repute for shrewdness and wisdom, or perhaps of
commanding talents and influence, and by the array of
great names which he sometimes sees appended to certificates.
A sort of general license is thus given to empiricism
by this occasional endorsement by men of this character.</p>

<p>Some other reasons, besides those already mentioned, for
the want of success in efforts for the overthrow of
quackery, remain to be noticed.</p>

<p>The credulity in the public mind, that gives rise to the
errors on which quackery is based, is encouraged by a
similar credulity existing, to a considerable extent, in the
medical profession itself. If the physician is seen to believe
upon mere plausible evidence one thing, his friends will feel
justified in believing some other thing resting on similar
evidence. If he is not careful in sifting evidence, he
cannot expect that others around him will be. If he, for
example, give full credence to all the juggleries of animal
magnetism, and all the extravagancies of phrenology, as
they are put forth by travelling lecturers, how can he hope
to dissuade an undiscriminating public from exercising a
like credulity, in regard to the pretensions of quackery,
which are not a whit more extravagant and fallacious?</p>

<p>The influence of the example of physicians in sustaining
empiricism shows itself occasionally in a still more objectionable
mode, than the one just mentioned. The profession
sometimes gives its sanction to the credulity of the public,
not only by indulging a similar credulity, but by giving
currency to some of the measures with which the quack
deceives a credulous community. Many physicians, and
some of them of high standing, have for various reasons
given certificates in regard to patent medicines. Some too,
from the love of money, have even ministered to the empirical
tastes of the community, by getting up some secret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
nostrums of their own. Such physicians either boldly bid
defiance to an indignant profession, or save themselves from
merited disgrace and expulsion, by announcing, that they
are willing to make known, to any physician who asks it,
the composition of their medicines. By this miserable
artifice they comply with the letter of our regulations,
while they go directly counter to their spirit. For, after all,
the successful sale of their medicines requires the employment
of the same measures, to act upon the credulity of
the public, which are made use of by the whole herd of
ignorant quacks, and they commonly have little scruple in
resorting to them.</p>

<p>But there is a greater evil still, beyond all this, that exists
in the medical profession, hindering it from waging successful
war with empiricism. It is the <em>spirit</em> of quackery,
actuating quite a large proportion of the profession. It is
not always manifested in palpable shape, and in acts which
can be exposed to the contempt of all honorable men, but
it exerts a concealed and yet a constant influence upon the
habits of intercourse, prompting to the use of cunning arts
in order to deceive the community, exciting an overweening
desire for reputation, with an indifference to the grounds
upon which it is based, and producing a competition among
physicians that rests, to a great extent, if not wholly, upon
false issues. Where such a spirit exists, the object is not
so much to seek after truth, as it is to make out a good case
in the eyes of the public. No effort is therefore made to
correct the credulity of that public, but this is looked upon
as one of the instruments to be used for the attainment of
their selfish ends. They follow medicine as a trade, and this
is an essential part of their capital.</p>

<p>I need not spend time to show, that this subserviency of
medical men to the credulity of the public, is one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
worst obstacles to the eradication of the quackery which
results from this credulity. And this mode of self-aggrandizement
is an evil, which prevails in the profession to a
greater extent than is commonly supposed. It is so covert
and sly in the case of many physicians, that it is called by
their friends worldly wisdom, or perhaps even good judgment.
And the physician who adopts it, if he have much
conscience, quiets it with the consideration, that the world
cannot be reformed, but we must take it as it is; and he
looks upon the honest votary of medical science, that pursues
his investigations in obedience to a love of the truth,
independent of the whims of a credulous world, as a man
who has not sense enough to look out for his own interests.</p>

<p>It must be obvious to my readers, that a reform is needed
in the ranks of the medical profession, to enable it to exert
any commanding influence in the removal of empiricism.
Not only is its dignity impaired, but its energies are crippled,
in all its honest endeavors for this object, by the extent to
which that spirit, which I have described, prevails among
its members. It is not confined to a few of the ignorant
and grossly unprincipled, who have stolen into our ranks;
but it is seen to a greater or less degree even in some who
occupy stations of power and influence, and in quite a
large portion of the common mass of practitioners. This
may be considered by some as too strong a charge to bring
against so noble a profession; but my own observation, and
that of other physicians from different parts of our country,
prove it to be a true charge.</p>

<p>Let then the profession be purged. Let the true spirit of
investigation animate all the members of it, instead of only
a portion of them. Let that short-sighted policy, which
relies upon the credulity of the community for success,
instead of attempting to correct it, be given up. Let all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
false issues be avoided. Let reputation be sought after on
true grounds, and let competition be honorable, and therefore
such as will further the cause of truth, and promote the
interests of the profession, and not sacrifice them to mere
temporary self-aggrandizement, as is now so often done.</p>

<p>If such could be the prevailing spirit of the profession,
and if each member of it should undertake to exert his
individual influence in the way that I have pointed out,
there is no doubt that a most effectual blow would be given
at once to the domination of quackery. The whole
profession then, instead of being dispirited by the errors
and inconsistencies of a large portion of its members, as
it now is, conscious of the strength which self-respect
always inspires, would present a bold, unbroken front in its
warfare with empiricism. The community then would not,
as they do now, take a license for their own credulity and
quackery from that of medical men; but the uniform
example of the profession, in its search after truth, would
always rebuke the spirit of empiricism, and prevent, in a
great measure at least, the sensible and well informed from
coming under its influence. That such a change can be
produced, to a great extent at least, I have not a doubt.
But in order to accomplish it, all the honorable and the true
votaries of medical science must be aroused to the effort,
and must make common cause both against the abuses that
exist in our own ranks, and the abounding and multiform
quackery of the public. And because some of the occasional
efforts which have been put forth by individuals for
this object have effected but little, we should not therefore
despair as to the success of a general and united effort.</p>

<p>We would call upon the stable and well-informed in the
community to co-operate with us in effecting this change.
They can render us very material assistance. In what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
ways they can do this I will endeavor very briefly to point
out.</p>

<p>One of the most effectual means of eradicating quackery
is the promotion of a thorough education of the medical
profession. The lower the standard of education is among
medical men, the greater will be the number of ignorant
pretenders who will gain admission into their ranks, and
consequently the greater will be the prevalence of quackery
in the profession, and of course in the community. This
result is the more certain to follow, because deception and
imposture are practised upon the public so much more easily
in medicine, than in regard to other subjects. And it is for
this reason that it is for the interest of the community to have
a proper standard of medical education maintained <em>much
more even than it is for the interest of the profession itself</em>.
For so little are they qualified to judge on medical subjects,
and so much are they obliged to take medical practice upon
trust, that it is important for them, that they should have all
the benefit of the safeguards the requisitions of our
professional organizations throw around them. And this
leads me to say, that it is only through these organizations
that a proper education of the profession can be secured.
Imperfect as they are, and much as they fall short of
accomplishing fully the object, if they were done away, as
some self-styled reformers, who hate all ‘regularism,’ desire,
empiricism would abound vastly more than it does even
now, for the door then would be opened widely for the impostures
which it so easily practises upon the people.</p>

<p>The community are much at fault in their opinions and
practices on this subject. These organizations are lightly
esteemed, and sometimes even treated with contempt.
Even those who are shrewd and judicious in all other matters,
often put the quack of a day on a level with the accredited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
physician, laden with the carefully gathered experience
of years, or perhaps even above him, and welcome
with open arms the advocate of some new system for the
moment high in favor, with scarcely any regard to the
inquiry, whether he has been educated in any proper manner
for the responsible post into which he has thrust himself.
Many a man of fair address, and a good share of
cunning, with but a mere smattering of medical knowledge,
has dubbed himself a physician, and, adopting Homœopathy,
or some other system just then in fashion, has imposed
not only upon the ignorant, but the intelligent and learned.</p>

<p>This ought not so to be. The public should, one and all,
feel that they are personally interested in upholding a well-educated
medical profession. Here is a science which is
confessedly difficult above all others, and in which, as you
have seen, careless observation is peculiarly liable to error.
How important then, that those who take charge of your
health, your life, should be careful and skilful observers.
And education is obviously as much needed to form good
habits of observation in this, as it is in other sciences. But
let me say, that whenever you give countenance to quackery,
whether it be in the shape of a secret nostrum, or a fashionable
system, you strike a blow at the standard of medical
education. You in effect say to the physician, observe,
watch, study as much as you will, we esteem all your labor
and experience vain. When men of wisdom and influence
do thus, as I am sorry to say they often do, it certainly casts
contempt upon education, and therefore tends to lower its
standard in the profession. For if physicians see, that they
can acquire the esteem of the public without study and
labor, many will be disposed to give them up, and take the
easier path to success, into which they are thus invited.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
And this is the grand reason, why so many pretenders are
found in the ranks of the medical profession.</p>

<p>Before I leave this topic let me correct one error, which
is quite prevalent in regard to the basis of our organizations.
We are charged with being proscriptive in regard to opinions.
We are called in vulgar cant <em>regulars</em>, and we are
supposed to have ‘regular’ systems of doctrine and practice,
and to maintain a deadly hostility to any opinion which
is opposed to these systems. This may be true of individuals,
but it is not true of the great body of the profession.
We allow of the utmost latitude of belief. We have no
creed, nor sets of creeds. We thrust none out of our medical
societies for opinion’s sake. Any member may adopt
any doctrine or system he pleases, however much opposed
to the opinions of the great majority—Homœopathy, Hydropathy,
or even Thompsonism. Education is the qualification
for admission to our ranks; and nothing but a gross
and obstinate infraction of our rules of intercourse, which
are based upon truth and honor and benevolence, can be
made the ground of expulsion.</p>

<p>Another way in which the stable-minded and well-informed
can assist the medical profession, in the eradication of
quackery, is by renouncing all fallacious means of judging
of the merits of physicians, and relying upon those which I
have shown to be so apt to lead to correct conclusions.
For an extended view of this subject I refer the reader to
the chapter on Popular Estimates of Physicians. And I
will only remark here, that, while the honorable practitioner
desires from his employers an <em>intelligent</em> confidence, the
quack and the quackish physician are very willing, that the
community should continue to judge of medical men by
the same false rules, which have been so long in vogue,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
because they subserve so well their narrow and selfish purposes.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The sensible and influential in the community can render
effectual aid in the overthrow of quackery, by promoting
the strict observance of the rules of medical intercourse.
These rules are not sufficiently understood and appreciated
by the public. If they were, those who have influence in
society would frown down the base arts of a cunning competition,
instead of encouraging them, as they now often
do; and would give no countenance to the false issues,
upon which empirics and dishonorable physicians so much
depend for their success. For a full view of this subject I
refer my readers to the chapter on the Intercourse of Physicians.</p>

<p>A recent movement of the medical profession in this
country, if I mistake not, is destined to exert a great and a
permanent agency in the overthrow of empiricism. I refer
to the formation of the “American Medical Association”
in 1847. Although the meeting in Boston in May last was
only the <em>second</em> annual meeting of the Association, so fully
did the profession throughout the country respond to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
call, that the number of the delegates amounted to about
four hundred and fifty. The measures which have already
been entered upon, and the spirit which has been manifested,
clearly indicate, that the great object for which the Association
was formed, “the elevation and advancement of
our common calling” will be rigorously and steadily prosecuted.
The recurrence of this <em>festival</em> of the profession
from year to year, I fully believe, will be marked by real
advances in all the interests of medical science.</p>

<p>And now, I ask, is it too much to expect of the stable
and well-informed in the community, that they will give
their countenance to the objects at which we aim? While
we are thus struggling together to elevate the standard of
medical education, and to rid our noble profession of the
abuses which impair its honor and its usefulness, we have a
right to demand of the community, which is to be especially
benefitted by these efforts, a cheerful and active support.
Whether this shall be given us, will depend upon the men
of influence in every profession and occupation in our land.
It is to them that we make our appeal, and we believe that
it will not be made in vain.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">[35]</a> There is nothing by which the quackish practitioner is more plainly
distinguished from the honorable one, than by the mode of competition in
which he engages, and the kind of reputation at which he aims. He resorts
to tricks, and raises false issues. He boasts of success; and, if he do it
skilfully, he does not much endanger his reputation for a proper degree
of modesty. He is always finding out something wonderful in his cases—something
which it is supposed other physicians have not acuteness enough
to discern. He loves to see the credulous, whether learned or unlearned,
gaze at his wonders, and to hear the loose tongues of gossipers busy in his
praise. He aims at a reputation for performing great cures in cases in
which others have been said to fail—<em>a reputation which no honorable physician
ever has, however eminent he may be, because he does not seek after
it</em>. Every quack seeks for it, and acquires it to a greater or less extent.
The physician can have it if he will make it his aim, but in doing this he
puts himself on a level with the quack in the common field of empiricism.</p>

</div>

<p>The object of this chapter is to notice some points in
relation to the intercourse of physicians, which the community
ought to understand, and to correct some prevalent
errors, which tend to destroy the harmony of the profession,
and to impair its usefulness.</p>

<p>Mistaken notions are very prevalent, even among thinking
and judicious men, both in regard to the object of
consultations, and the principles by which they should be
regulated. These notions sometimes exert a very injurious
influence, and the patient is deprived of the benefit to which
he has a right, from the combined wisdom of those who
consult upon his case.</p>

<p>What then is the main object of a consultation, is an
important inquiry.</p>

<p>It seems to be considered by many as the chief object of
a consultation to decide the question, whether the patient
will die or recover. We hear ignorant people talk about
a ‘jury of doctors,’ and they ask ‘what they gave in,’ as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
a sort of verdict was to be pronounced of a decisive, almost
a binding, character, in regard to the result of the case.
The same erroneous ideas are, to some extent, to be found
among sensible and well informed people, though they are
expressed in a different way. Let me not be understood to
say, that the question, whether the patient will probably
recover, should not come up for consideration at all. But
it is certainly a gross error to suppose, that the decision of
this question is a principal object of the consultation. It
is in fact a merely incidental object, and it is profitable only
as it may have some bearing upon the treatment, as it
sometimes does, though much less often, and to a less
extent, than is commonly supposed. Sometimes, I may say
often, nothing like a decision of this question can be arrived
at. Farther developments in the progress of the case must
be waited for before this can be done.</p>

<p>Neither is it the object of a consultation to have the
physician who is called in prescribe to the attending physician
what he shall do; though this is often considered to
be the object, especially when the consulting physician is
much older than the one who is in attendance upon the
case. <em>Dictation</em> is certainly very far from being consultation.</p>

<p>Again. It should not be among the objects of the friends
of the sick, in calling a consultation, to obtain the opinion
of the physician who is called in upon the course of treatment
which has been pursued. He has nothing to do with
the past, except so far as it will aid him in discovering the
true nature of the case, and in fixing upon the course to be
adopted at the present time. He steps out of his province
altogether, if he says anything to the friends in regard to
what <em>has</em> been done. This general rule applies not only to
criticisms upon practice, but to all expressions of approbation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
also. The patronizing air, with which some physicians
utter their commendations of the course, which has been
pursued by the attending practitioner, is a most flagrant insult.
It generally involves an unwarrantable and ridiculous
assumption of superiority. It is a common trick resorted
to by the dishonorable, to impress upon the by-standers an
idea of their greatness.</p>

<p>The friends of the sick often put the consulting physician
in an awkward position, by the inquiries which they
make of him in regard to the measures which have been
pursued. If he really approves of them all, of course there
is no difficulty. But suppose that he does not—that he
cannot say with truth, that if he had been called to the case
at the first he should have adopted precisely the same
course. What answer shall he make then to the inquiries
put to him? Shall he reply to them fully and frankly? By
no means. It would be cruel both to the friends of the
patient and to the physician to do so. He has no right to
take such a course, unless there be gross and palpable mal-practice,
which the good of the patient and of the community
requires should be exposed. This is the only case
which can justify such a measure. Where there exists
merely that difference of opinion, which results from the
various individual notions and preferences and doctrines of
physicians, all such inquiries of the friends of the sick should
not be replied to.</p>

<p>There are also some exceptions to the rule in its application
to expressions of approbation. If for example an
older and well-established physician, on being called in to
the patient of a junior member of the profession, sees that
the propriety of the course, which has been pursued, has
been called in question by some of the friends or by busy
bodies, it is his duty to volunteer in the defence of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
course if he can conscientiously do it. Older physicians
often have such opportunities of doing essential service to
meritorious young men.</p>

<p>It is only such cases as I have mentioned, which form
the exceptions to the rule laid down. The general practice
of remarking upon what has been done cannot be too
severely reprobated, as opening a wide door for cunning
intrigue and ungenerous insinuation. The honorable physician
desires no such privilege, but the dishonorable prize
it highly, as one of the means of inflicting their base
wounds upon the reputation of their competitors. Such
physicians are ever ready to answer the inquiries of friends
and neighbors, about the previous treatment, in every case
to which they are called. They commonly prefer to do
this in a corner, rather than openly. Whenever they see
that a stab can be given to the professional character of
any competitor they do it, and often so stealthily, that it is
not seen. A word, a look, a mere movement of the head
may do it, and perhaps oftener does it than any tangible
expression of opinion. An open show of the weapon that
inflicts the wound the cunning and dishonorable physician
most studiously avoids.</p>

<p>In this connexion I may remark, that the bandying about
of the opinions of this and that physician, in regard to different
cases, by their partizans, is one of the chief causes of
the jealousies and quarrels among the members of our profession.
If the friends of the sick would ask simply for the
result of the consultation, instead of endeavoring to obtain
the opinions of each physician in regard to the various
points of the case, it would manifestly shut out all opportunity
for intrigue at such times. And it is to this result
alone that they have any right under ordinary circumstances.
When a consultation is held, it is expected that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
some definite conclusion is to be arrived at, in relation to the
nature of the case, and the treatment of it. It is the result
of a <em>deliberative</em> body, no matter of how few, or how many
it consists. The individual opinions expressed in the deliberations
leading to this result are wholly confidential;
and whoever reveals them without the consent of the parties
is guilty of a breach of confidence. So long as the
attending physician is alone in the case, he acts as an individual;
but when a consultation is called individual action
ceases, and he is now to act in obedience to the result of
the consultation—his duty is simply to carry out that result.
He is the <em>executive</em> of the acts of the deliberative body. He
alone is to give the directions in the management of the
case. If the consulting physician gives any directions
either voluntarily, or in answer to the inquiries of the friends,
he usurps authority which does not belong to him. His
business is simply counsel, deliberation, and not action;
unless, as in some surgical cases, he is called in for both
purposes.</p>

<p>The chief object of consultation, which is to fix upon the
best course to be pursued in the treatment of the patient, is
to be secured by thorough and free investigation and discussion
of the different points of the case. Anything which
interferes with this mode of attaining the object has a tendency
to defeat it. If, for example, jealousy exist—if one
physician feels that the other is disposed to take advantage
of anything that may occur, which can possibly be turned
to his own benefit, there can be none of that frankness
which is so essential to the accomplishment of the object
proposed. A consultation between enemies is generally a
failure, though the friends of the patient may not always
know it. At the same time, let it be remembered, that the
mere fact that physicians are competitors does not necessarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
make them enemies. If the competition be an
honorable one, and neither is disposed to treat the other in
an ungentlemanly manner, there is nothing to hinder their
consultation from being free and unembarrassed.</p>

<p>Physicians should always be alone in a consultation.</p>

<p>The presence of others would prevent that freedom of
discussion, which in some cases is so necessary. For each
physician, knowing that his individual opinions will be reported
by those who are present, would be very cautious in
expressing them, and there would therefore be none of that
freeness of suggestion and discussion, which is so desirable
in a consultation. And farther than this, while the honest
and high-minded physician would be simply embarrassed
under such circumstances, the selfish and unprincipled physician
would, on the other hand, express his opinions with
a view to their effect upon his own standing with those
who are present, while the welfare of the patient would be
altogether a secondary object. His main object would not
be consultation based upon a rigid investigation of the case,
but an exhibition of his skill and knowledge to the non-professional
listeners.</p>

<p>The reasons which I have thus briefly given, are, I trust,
sufficient to show the reader the reasonableness of the rule,
which excludes the friends of the sick from the consultations
of the physicians. But it is sometimes spoken of as
unreasonable, and a strict adherence to it is considered by
some as implying a want of frankness and candor. Tattlers
and busy-bodies are ready to attribute some sinister
design to this bar which is put upon their curiosity; and
some physicians, especially in the country, where there is
apt to be less regard to strict rules in medical intercourse,
than in our cities, sometimes flatter this prejudice, and
assuming an air of frankness in the expression of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
opinions, adroitly throw the responsibility of the exclusion
upon some of their brethren.</p>

<p>The intrigues, which are practised by the cunning and
dishonorable in connexion with consultations, are very
numerous. I will notice a few of them.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when there is perfect agreement between
physicians in a consultation, the friends of the patient in
some way get the impression that their views of the case
are really different. They therefore sound the consulting
physician on the subject. If he be an honorable man, he
will at once say that they have agreed upon the course to
be pursued, that he approves of it entirely, and that the
attending physician will carry it into effect. But if he be
unprincipled and intriguing, he will increase the impression,
or even create it if it do not already exist, that there is
disagreement; and he will do it so adroitly, that, while he
will say nothing that is tangible, he will yet excite curiosity
to know his views more fully, and feed the desire, which
perhaps some partizan of his has awakened by his representations,
that he shall take charge of the patient. If he
thus gets possession of the case, as is often done, he will
perhaps adopt the very course agreed upon in consultation
with his brother physician, from whom he has filched it,
and will alter only the <em>form</em> of the medicines, so as to give
the appearance of an actual change in the treatment.</p>

<p>If after a consultation the patient improves, and the
change is attributed by his friends to some particular remedy,
credit is sometimes acquired by the dishonorable physician,
by producing the impression that the remedy was
suggested by himself. He makes perhaps no distinct assertion
to that effect, especially if there be no ground for it,
but in his conversations with the patient and his friends,
he throws out such hints, and manifests so much interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
and delight in speaking of the effects of the remedy, that
the desired impression is made.</p>

<p>When, on the other hand, a case terminates fatally, and,
as often happens, the friends of the patient are disposed to
find fault, and fix upon some remedy, or measure, as the
chief cause of death, the intriguing practitioner seeks to
make capital for himself by fastening the blame upon the
physician who had the management of the case. He does
this, not by any direct and open attack upon him, for then
he would be exposed, but by slyly ministering to prejudices
which he finds awakened against him, or by exciting such
prejudices by insinuations, and remarks of so indefinite a
character, that he is effectually screened from detection.</p>

<p>Physicians who are called in consultation often have
opportunities of defending the reputation of the attending
physician from unjust attacks. And if they fail to make
the defence when truth demands it, they may be quite as
guilty as they would be if they volunteered the attack
themselves, for they give to it their sanction; and yet, by
doing no positive act, they shield themselves from blame.
Lending a listening ear to aspersions upon the reputation of
a medical brother, negative as the act is, is under some circumstances
more base, and does more harm, than any open
and bold attack.</p>

<p>An artifice, which is not unfrequently employed by the
dishonorable physician after being called in consultation,
is this. On meeting some friend of the patient he inquires
very particularly about the case, asks whether this or that
medicine or measure has been tried, expresses by word, or
perhaps only by his manner, some surprise at being answered
in the negative, though he really has no reason for
doing so, and says that he will see the attending physician
in relation to the matter. He does not see him—he has no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
intention to do so. His only object is to create dissatisfaction,
or, if the patient dies, to produce the impression, that
the measures which he alluded to were agreed upon, and
ought to have been followed, and if they had been, they
perhaps would have saved the patient.</p>

<p>The selfish and cunning physician is apt to make comparisons
between the cases to which he is called in consultation,
and some of his own cases of the same complaint,
which he speaks of as having been very severe, though
they terminated successfully. His object is to set forth his
own skill, and in doing this he commonly very much over-estimates
the severity of the disease in his own cases.</p>

<p>Some physicians <em>manifest</em> a deep interest in the patients of
their brethren, and make many inquiries of their friends, in
regard to the nature of the disease, and the mode of treatment.
And if their services are requested in consultation,
they are exceedingly attentive at the time, and make some
very friendly calls afterwards. This undue attention, assuming
the guise of great kindness and a lively interest in
the welfare of the patient, though a burdensome and pains-taking
trick, is nevertheless a very common one.</p>

<p>Sometimes a physician is called in consultation in a case
which is not of a grave character, because the friends of
the patient think that the attending physician places too
low an estimate upon the severity of the disease. If he be
an honorable man, he will under such circumstances have
no hesitation as to his duty, but will at once say, that the
attending physician is right in his views of the case, and
that they are unnecessarily alarmed. The cunning and
dishonorable practitioner pursues a different course. He
makes a great show of examining the case thoroughly, asking
many utterly needless questions; and, though he may
sooth the anxieties of the family of the patient, and express<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
the belief that he will recover, he does it in such a way as
to favor the impression, that the attending physician was
not really aware of the magnitude of the case, but that <em>he</em>
on the other hand, has estimated it aright, and has looked
into it as it should be done.</p>

<p>The dishonorable physician often makes difficulty, by attempting
to hold on to the patient of another, when he has
been called in a case of emergency. His plain duty under
such circumstances is to give up the patient to the family
physician when he arrives, or to request that, for this purpose,
he should be sent for, if it has not already been done.
And in all cases, in which the physician is doubtful,
whether he has been called accidentally or from choice, he
should take measures to remove the doubt. Some, in their
eagerness to get practice, make no effort to settle this
question, but disregard all the evidence which may appear
against their claim to the patient; and, taking it for granted
that the case is theirs, proceed at once to its treatment,
and hang on to it till they are actually driven from the
ground. And if they have a good share of assurance, they
manage by this dishonorable course to keep possession of
many cases which rightfully belong to their more modest
neighbors. For many persons, from the fear of giving offence,
are reluctant to tell them frankly that their services
are needed only for the present emergency, and the physician
of the family feels that it would be at least awkward
for him to assert his rights under such circumstances.</p>

<p>Sometimes a second physician is sent for to see a patient
without the knowledge of the one in attendance. This
may be done from the whim of the moment, or from the
earnest recommendation of some meddler, or from a desire
to obtain the opinions of another practitioner, which, it is
perhaps thought, will be more candid and unbiassed, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
a formal consultation. A strictly honorable man,
when thus called in, declines giving any opinion at all, for
he considers that he has no right to have anything to do
with the case, unless he meets the attending physician in
consultation, or the case is fully and openly transferred to
his care. Not so with the dishonorable and intriguing
physician. Such calls furnish him with opportunities for
exercising his cunning, which are too good to be lost.</p>

<p>It is a very common idea, that physicians are generally
attached, to a foolish degree, to the rules of etiquette in
their intercourse. Many talk as if the welfare of the sick,
and sometimes even life, is sacrificed to it. The physician
is often entreated to lay it aside, as being an obstacle in the
way of his usefulness. When, for example, he is sent for
to visit the patient of another physician without his knowledge,
it is perhaps said to him, ‘we wish you to give up
all etiquette—if you can do any good to this poor sufferer,
do it.’</p>

<p>The impression which is so common in regard to this
subject is an erroneous one. The rules of intercourse
which govern the medical profession abridge no man’s
liberty. A strict adherence to them favors freedom of intercourse,
by maintaining mutual confidence; while a disregard
of them destroys this freedom, by engendering mutual
distrust. The truly honorable physician is therefore
always scrupulous in obeying them, while the dishonorable
physician prefers a lax observance, because it furnishes
him with occasional opportunities of obtaining by his manœuvres
advantages over his medical brethren.</p>

<p>I have thus noticed, as briefly as I could, some of the
dishonorable practices which are common among physicians,
impairing the harmony of their intercourse, and therefore
limiting the usefulness of the profession. I have done so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
principally because the community do not appreciate in any
just degree the evil of these practices, and therefore those
who are guilty of them generally escape with impunity,
especially in the country, where there is no medical public
opinion to control them, as there is in the cities and larger
towns. It is well that the ‘tricks of the trade’ should be
understood; and that the public should be able to discriminate,
better than it now does, between those who are honorable
practitioners, and those who are not.</p>

<p>The differences, the jealousies, and the quarrels of medical
men have become proverbial. ‘Who shall decide when
doctors disagree,’ is often uttered as a reproach upon the
profession, not only in regard to its opinions but its practices
also. It is manifest to every one, that a jealous and
quarrelsome spirit is more prevalent among physicians, than
it is in the other professions. The reasons for this I will
briefly notice.</p>

<p>These reasons are to be found in the peculiar circumstances
which attend the relations of physicians to each
other, and the community.</p>

<p>As the reader has already seen, the public have, for the
most part at least, no <em>direct</em> means of judging of the correctness
of a physician’s practice, for the whole science of
medicine is to them a mystery. He can commit the most
gross and fatal errors, even while his patients and their
friends may be reposing the most unlimited confidence in
his skill and wisdom. His professional intercourse with
them is indeed wholly a matter of confidence. The positions
advanced by the lawyer can commonly be correctly
appreciated by ordinary intelligence; the doctrines proclaimed
by the clergyman it is the privilege and the duty
of every man to examine by the light of the Bible; but the
prescriptions of the physician must for the most part be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
taken upon trust. There is great room therefore for imposition;
and the more, because with all this ignorance of
medicine, most people are apt to think that they have no
inconsiderable amount of knowledge on this subject.</p>

<p>It is in this facility with which deception can be practiced
upon the community, that we find the principal circumstance
that fosters the jealousies, the disagreements,
and the bickerings which disgrace the medical profession.
For it is this facility which tempts to the use of all those
arts and manœuvres, that are so common among physicians.
If the practice of these were confined to empirics, and to
physicians who have an established character as dishonorable
and intriguing men, the evil would by no means be as
great as it now is. But it is not thus confined. The facility
for deception is so great, and the temptations to turn it
to profit are so many and constant, that many physicians,
who are in the main honorable, occasionally yield to the
temptation. This of course begets to some extent a general
distrust, and then circumstances from time to time produce
jealousy, perhaps disagreement and strife.</p>

<p>This state of things is promoted by the peculiar relations
which the physician sustains to his employers. They are
generally his warm friends, and are ready to act with zeal
in his favor, and to recommend him earnestly to those upon
whom they have any influence. The attachment of families
to their physician is somewhat peculiar, differing essentially
from the preferences which are felt in regard to other
professional men. The result is, that each physician has a
party in the community composed of all classes and ages,
and a large portion of that party are active in urging his
claims. This of itself so affects the competition in which
he is engaged with his brethren, that it is apt to awaken
distrust and jealousy. And besides, interferences are sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
practised which aggravate the difficulty. Some attribute
most of the strifes of physicians to these interferences;
and assert that if their friends would let them alone, there
would generally be no want of harmony among them.
Though there is some truth in this remark, yet it is certain
that physicians are often the prompters of these interferences.
Some physicians always have a troop of busy-bodies
trumpeting their fame. They have a tact in drawing
such persons into their train, and they do it by precisely
the same means by which the quack accomplishes the same
object. The quack and the quackish physician are alike in
this respect. The prompting influence, thus exerted, may
not always be obvious, and sometimes is least so when it is
the most effectual. The old adage, that the highest evidence
of art is in the concealment of art, is applicable
here.</p>

<p>The disposition to jealousy and strife in the medical profession
is also promoted by the associations which are sometimes
formed by physicians with each other, or with the
community, for the sake of furthering their own selfish ends.
Professional cliques on the one hand, and alliances with
various societies, social, moral or religious, on the other,
when relied upon as means of advancing one’s professional
interests, are always inimical to the harmony of medical
men. They render competition unfair and dishonorable
and therefore contentious. The physician who calls to his
aid the influence of a sect, or a party, or an association of
any sort, in so doing not only places himself in an attitude
to awaken distrust, but subjects himself in maintaining the
alliance to a necessity for employing means of self-aggrandisement,
which will conflict with the rights of others, and
will therefore involve himself in either a secret, or an open
warfare with his brethren.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>It is peculiarly true of the physician, that he will always
find it for his interest and especially for his comfort, to obey
the injunction of the Apostle, ‘If it be possible, as much as
lieth in you live peaceably with all men.’ Sometimes it is
hardly ‘possible’ even for the strictly honest and honorable
to do so. It is sometimes difficult to restrain the outburst
of an honest indignation provoked by the base tricks of
physicians, who, in spite of such tricks, hold an honorable
position before the community. But it is best to do it, if
‘possible.’ For even if the act complained of be clearly
and palpably a disgraceful one, the public, with their present
ideas of the rules of medical intercourse, will not generally
appreciate the true merits of the case. The friends of the
physician who has committed the act will be disposed to
think him right; and those who feel indifferent to the matter,
will turn it off with the old remark, ‘two of a trade cannot
agree,’ as if that settled it. If one who has been injured
by a competitor manifest any sensitiveness, and is earnest
in denouncing the act, he will generally make the matter
worse for himself. And if his opponent keep still, and utter
the little which he does say very slily, he will be sure to
gain an advantage over his more honest, but less cunning,
neighbor. It is especially true of the medical profession,
that one gives dignity to a dishonorable opponent by stooping
to quarrel with him. The artful often endeavor to provoke
the honorable to strife, managing at the same time to
produce the impression upon the public mind, that they
themselves have no disposition to quarrel. The best course
therefore, commonly is, to avoid as much as possible, and
in a very quiet way, having any intercourse with the artful
and intriguing in the profession.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the interferences of the friends of physicians
as occasioning jealousy and contention in the profession.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
It is proper to remark that such interferences ought
to produce no ill feeling, unless they are prompted or justified
by physicians themselves. No physician should be
held responsible for all the injudicious or mischievous acts,
which may be done by over-zealous patrons in his behalf.
I would also remark in this connection, that the representations
which are made by the friends of physicians in regard
to the acts or sayings of their competitors, which are so
apt to excite ill feeling, and foment so many quarrels, are
very often to be received with many grains of allowance,
and sometimes are wholly false.</p>

<p>When the medical man has arrived at that period of life,
when, from the amount of his experience through a long
practice, he will be called upon often by younger physicians
in consultation, he may stand in a very enviable position.
He <em>may</em>, I say, for it depends altogether upon those habits
of intercourse which he has cultivated from the beginning.
If he has been governed by wrong principles in his competition
with his brethren, and has treated them in an ungentlemanly
manner, mutual distrust and jealousy will mark
the intercourse between him and younger physicians, and
his situation will be far from being a desirable one. His
standing with the community may give him the power of
extracting from them the show of respect, and some of them
may be attached to him as partizans, from mere motives of
policy, but he cannot obtain from them a true respect and
attachment. It is melancholy sometimes to see the intriguing
practitioner, tottering on the brink of the grave, as
busy as ever with his petty arts in filching whatever he can
get of credit, or respect, or advantage, in his competition
with his medical brethren.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the physician has been governed by
honorable principles in his intercourse, when he acquires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
the eminence which the fact of having had a long and
thorough experience gives him, the respect of his younger
brethren is cheerfully accorded to him, and his declining
years are made happy, being free from the strifes and jealousies
which so often disgrace our profession.</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter I remark, that neither controversy
in regard to opinions, nor competition in practice,
necessarily implies contention. Though the controversy
may be earnest, and the competition active, so long as the
former is honest and candid, and the latter is honorable,
they will not impair the harmony of the profession, and
they will greatly promote the cause of truth, and the interests
of medical science.</p>

<span class="fs80">INTERFERENCE WITH PHYSICIANS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Great latitude is allowed by the community in interfering
with the practice of physicians. It is the object of this
chapter to point out some of the ways in which this interference
is exercised, and some of the injurious consequences
which result from it.</p>

<p>Sometimes the confidence which one feels in his own
physician leads him to put a low estimate upon the merits
of other physicians and to attempt to destroy the hold
which they have upon the confidence of their employers.
Though this is very common, it is a most unjustifiable
interference. While it is right that every one should be
attached to the physician who has done well for him and
his family in their sickness, this furnishes no ground for
disparaging the physician to whom another is attached,
perhaps for just as good reasons. He may sincerely believe
that his friend has misplaced his confidence. But let him
ask himself, am I sure—do I <em>know</em>, that it is so? Have I
the data on which I can properly base such an opinion?
Am I competent to judge of the comparative merits of the
two physicians from observing their practice? If every
one, who is tempted by a mere preference, or by pride of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
opinion to practice the interference referred to, should put
to himself such questions as these, he would at least be less
positive in his opinions, and less zealous in his efforts to
unsettle the confidence of others in the physicians whom
they employ.</p>

<p>Let me not be understood to mean that interference is
proper in no case whatever. There are cases, in which it
is not only allowable, but it is even an imperative duty. If
you see a friend confiding in a quack, or an unskilful and
ignorant practitioner, it is your duty to persuade him to
relinquish such a misplaced confidence. But you must
remember that the evidence upon which you act should be
clear and satisfactory, and that no mere preference can
justify such an interference, however strong that preference
may be. So also, if you have a friend, who trusts his own
life and that of his family in the hands of an intemperate
practitioner, it is a case which calls loudly for the warnings of
friendship. But in this case, you must have better evidence
of the fact, upon which your advice is based, than mere
suspicion, or vague reports.</p>

<p>Some of those, who are fond of practising the interference
under consideration, hesitate not to make the most severe
and reckless attacks upon the professional reputation of
physicians. Indeed, such attacks are quite common in all
circles. Though the non-professional observer, as you
have seen, is not capable of estimating correctly the results
of medical practice, many are in the habit of expressing
their opinions upon this subject freely, and sometimes very
harshly, especially when any case comes to a fatal issue.
In such a case the busy partizans of other physicians are
ready to cast blame upon the practitioner who has attended
upon it, though all they may know in relation to it may be
the idle rumors which come from gossiping tongues. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
interests of the physician are often seriously injured by the
reckless opinions thus expressed by men, who, though
wholly incompetent to judge in such matters, from their
wealth and standing have considerable influence.</p>

<p>The professional reputation of medical men seems to be
considered by common consent as fair game for the shafts
of all, whether high or low, learned or unlearned. Although
the charge of mal-practice is a serious charge, especially
when it has relation to the death of a patient, it is exceedingly
common to hear this charge put forth without any
hesitation, and in the most positive manner. So common
is it, that it awakens but little feeling; and, though it be a
shameful enormity, it seldom meets with any rebuke. A
very severe rebuke was once administered by a judge in
Massachusetts to a lawyer, for hinting at the charge of
mal-practice against a physician, who was one of the
parties in a case before the Court. The insinuation was
intended as a sort of make-weight for the advantage of his
client. The judge at once inquired of the lawyer, if he
intended to make that a point, giving him to understand,
that if he did, he would be expected to produce evidence
bearing upon it. The lawyer said that he did not. ‘You
will withdraw that point then,’ said the judge, ‘and indulge
in no farther remarks upon it.’ Very soon, however, he
made the same insinuation again. The judge interrupted
him, and remarked, that, as a professional man’s reputation
was of the highest value to him, and was even the means
of his livelihood, he would not suffer it to be wantonly
attacked in any case; and he told the lawyer, that, as he
had twice brought the charge of mal-practice against this
physician, he should not permit him to go on with his plea,
till he had withdrawn it in <em>writing</em>. It would be well if the
same regard for the value of professional reputation were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
felt by all our judges, and by all the wise and influential in
the community.</p>

<p>Let me not be understood to claim, that the merits of
physicians should not be canvassed at all by the community.
There should be freedom of opinion upon this
subject; and, when it will accomplish any good purpose,
there should be freedom also in expressing that opinion.
But the opinions of those who are ignorant of the subjects
to which they relate, and who are not in possession of the
facts in the case, ought at least to be uttered with some
degree of modesty, and a mere blind preference is no justification
of the bold opinionating, and the busy interference,
which are so common with the train of zealous partizans,
which some physicians draw after them.</p>

<p>Some in their zeal carry their interference even into the
chamber of the sick, and disturb its quiet with debates in
regard to the propriety of the practice which is pursued.
To say nothing of the evil resulting from the excitement
thus produced, the influence of the physician over the mind
of the patient, which, as you will see in another chapter, is
sometimes of great importance, is often destroyed in this
way. Hope is as real a cordial to the sick as any restorative
medicine that can be given. And the meddler, who
attempts to destroy the confidence of a patient in his physician,
and thus take from him the hope that he will be
relieved by his skill, does as cruel an act as if he entered
the sick room and snatched from the very lips of the
enfeebled, languishing, and perhaps dying man, the cordial
draught which was to revive him.</p>

<p>Some are zealous in their recommendation of medicines
to the sick, and perhaps even urge the patient to take them
without the knowledge of the attending physician. Such
meddlers have no scruples in regard to this interference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
with the physician’s course, so long as the responsibility of
the case remains upon his hands; but the moment that it is
proposed to them to take the responsibility upon themselves,
they shrink from it, notwithstanding the confidence and
earnestness with which they urge the use of their favorite
remedies.</p>

<p>It is amusing to see what various, and even opposite
measures are recommended by different persons in the
same case. The friends of a patient, who are anxious that
everything should be done to save a life so valuable and
dear to them, are often perplexed and troubled by the great
variety of remedies urged upon them, and the plausible
reasons, and the asserted cures, upon which these recommendations
are based. And not a little firmness is required
to resist the importunity of these meddlers, especially as it
is often prompted by undoubted kindness. But the welfare
of the patient demands it, and no fear of giving offence
should hinder from pursuing the proper course. The
adequate remedy in such circumstances is to thank such
meddlers for their kindness, and tell them that the measures
which they recommend shall be mentioned to the physician,
and, if he thinks proper, they shall be used.</p>

<p>Some are disposed to restrict physicians in regard to the
medicines which they shall give. While the practitioner
should avoid a useless war with the notions and caprices of
his employers, and should sometimes even yield to them in
unessential matters, it is ordinarily not only compromising
his own dignity and independence, but is doing an absolute
injury to the patient, to make any concessions on this point.
The omission of some remedy or measure, in obedience
to prejudice, may prove very injurious, and even in some
cases fatal. As a general rule, therefore, the physician
should claim his right to pursue his own course, independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
and untrammeled. He, and he alone, is responsible for the
proper management of the case before him, and his rights
are certainly commensurate with his responsibility, and
should not be interfered with. But those who make medicine
a trade, and who care more for popularity and patronage
than they do for the interests of science, or the welfare
of the sick, often submit, as a matter of policy, to this
interference with their rights. They will do anything to
satisfy their employers. They will, for example, pursue the
homœopathic mode of practice, if it be desired, and stoop
to the farce of infinitesimal globules. They must despise
themselves for so doing, and deserve to be despised by
others.</p>

<p>The frequency of a physician’s visits<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> should for the most
part be left to his own judgment; for if he is not to be
trusted in relation to this matter, he had better be dismissed,
and another employed in his place. The conscientious
physician is often much embarrassed by the complaints of
his patients on this point. Some complain that his visits are
too frequent, and others that they are not enough so. The
attendance of the physician is sometimes discontinued too
soon for the welfare of the patient, from motives of delicacy,
where this fault-finding is practised. And, on the
other hand, the extreme frequency of visits, which is sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
required of the practitioner, especially by the wealthy,
is in many cases injurious. For example, it may impair
the mental influence, which it is important that the physician
should maintain over his patient, or it may impose
upon him almost a necessity to use too much medication,
or to make too frequent changes in his course of practice in
the case.</p>

<p>I trust that it is now clear to the reader, that all interferences
with the practice of the physician are inconsistent
with the best management of the sick. They repress that
freedom of thought and action, which is an essential element
of success in the treatment of disease, as well as in
everything else. Even when no interference is intended,
the anxiety of friends is sometimes the cause of so much
embarrassment to the physician, as to be detrimental to the
welfare of the patient. And there is no doubt, that, in spite
of all the care that is lavished by numerous friends upon
the sick in the higher walks of life, they are often, from the
cause above alluded to, treated with less skill and judgment
than the miserably attended sick in the cheerless habitations
of the poor. This may appear at first though rather paradoxical
to the reader; but let us examine this point, and
you will easily see the reasonableness of the assertion.</p>

<p>I will suppose a case. A lady is sick under the care of
her physician. Her husband and friends are exceedingly
anxious in regard to the result of the case. They have
many inquiries to make of the physician about her symptoms,
his fears and hopes, the operation of medicines, &amp;c.
They ask him, perhaps, if he is not afraid that such a remedy
will produce such an effect, and such an one such an
effect; and they may even go so far as to attribute some
unfavorable symptom to some medicine that has been administered.
There are few physicians who are so independent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
that they will not feel themselves embarrassed under
such circumstances. The responsibility of an important
case in itself occasions sufficient embarrassment, without
adding to it by such a course. Napoleon, that shrewd observer
of men, saw this in the case of his wife, and governed
himself accordingly. He saw that there was danger,
and that the physician was in a measure paralyzed by his
sense of his responsibility. Instead of talking with him
about the difficulties of the case, and expressing his apprehensions,
he immediately said to him, “she is but a woman:
forget that she is an empress, and treat her as you would
the wife of a citizen of the Rue St. Denis.” This restored
confidence to the physician; and his treatment of his royal
patient was successful, when perhaps a timid course would
have been fatal to her.</p>

<p>Let me not be understood, that I would have the
friends of a patient make no inquiries at all of the physician
in relation to the case. His intercourse with them
should be candid and free, and the intelligent and honorable
physician wishes it to be so. All that I claim is, that
the practitioner should not be <em>harrassed</em> with inquiries, and
especially with such scrutiny, and such expressions of doubt
as to the effect of remedies, as shall indicate their lack of
confidence in the treatment, and therefore tend to destroy
his own confidence in it. The physician knows, and for
the most part should be left to judge, how much ought to
be communicated to the friends of a patient in relation to
his case.</p>

<p>Neither let me be understood to mean, that physicians
are afraid to have their practice watched and scanned.
Every honorable and intelligent practitioner is willing that
his treatment of any case be scanned most thoroughly, but
he would prefer that it should be done by <em>skilful</em> eyes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
The friends of the patient should always remember, that
they have not sufficient knowledge of the human system,
and of the effects of agents upon it, to appreciate properly
the workings of disease, and the operation of remedies; and
they should therefore be careful not to put themselves in
the attitude of <em>clinical</em> critics—a station for which none
but a physician is really fitted. The physician himself is in
constant danger of making wrong inferences, on account of
the complicated character of the system, and the various
circumstances which therefore modify the operation of
agents brought to bear upon it—even he, prepared as he is
by study and well-weighed experience to observe accurately,
is obliged to sift well the evidence in regard to the effects
of remedies, in order to avoid mistake in his conclusions.
How much more then should <em>they</em> be cautious in the inferences
which they draw, who have never studied the human
frame, and who have had but little experience of the
treatment of disease. And yet many make no scruple in
forming the most decided opinions of the practice of physicians,
in every case of which they have any knowledge,
however limited, and in proclaiming those opinions with all
the authority of an oracle. The practitioner is sometimes
so much harrassed by these meddlers that he is in danger
of mixing up with the measures of his practice expedients
to satisfy or foil their officiousness—a compound which
brings no benefit to the patient. The attention and the
skill of the physician should be <em>concentrated</em> upon one object—the
proper treatment of the case before him. And the
expenditure of his ingenuity, in using feints and practising
concealments, to avoid a collision with the whims and prejudices
of by-standers, impairs this concentration to the
injury of the patient, and that sometimes a <em>fatal</em> injury.</p>

<p>The influence of scrutiny in impairing the skilfulness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
action is seen on other subjects, as well as in the practice
of medicine. The eloquent clergyman, who would ordinarily
carry his audience along with him, while he is aiming
with clear mind and zealous heart to attain the <em>one</em> great
object of his preaching, the impression of the truth upon
the conscience would fail to produce the same effect upon
an audience of <em>critics</em>. For, to say nothing of the embarrassment
which the very idea of criticism occasions, his
attention would be distracted by supposed criticisms, which
would suggest themselves to his mind while he is speaking;
and that concentration of mental and moral energies upon
one object, which is essential to true eloquence, would be
wanting. To be eloquent before such an audience, he must
either disarm their criticism, or he must forget that they are
critics, and look upon them only as men whose minds are
to be impressed and whose feelings are to be moved by the
truth.</p>

<p>Take another illustration of quite a different character.
A noted juggler perceived, at the commencement of his
performance, that he was very narrowly watched by a gentleman
whom he knew at once to be a very acute observer.
He was embarrassed, as I have seen a practicer of the juggleries
of animal magnetism embarrassed by a similar cause,
and he felt that he could not practice his deceptions with so
free and easy a hand, as he could if he were not watched by
so an intelligent an eye. The consciousness of being thus
watched distracted his mind, and prevented him from concentrating
its energies upon one object. The juggler
immediately gave this gentleman a piece of money, telling
him that he must look out or he would get it away from
him in the course of the evening. At the conclusion of the
exhibition the gentleman said to the juggler, ‘well, sir, here
is your money—you see that I have kept it safely.’ ‘Yes,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
replied he, ‘and I meant that you should, for I chose that
you should have something else to watch besides me.’</p>

<p>The case of the physician, whose practice is scrutinized
by by-standers, is worse even than that of the criticized
clergyman, or the watched juggler. For the criticism to
which he is subjected is not skilful, and is therefore not
capable of appreciating the merit of the measures which
he employs. In the case of the clergyman, the analogy
would be more correct if his audience were illiterate, and
his subject were one of an abstruse and metaphysical character.
Their criticism would then bear a strong resemblance
to that to which the practice of the physician is often made
to submit. If the physician investigate the case before him,
thoroughly and scientifically, the reasonings upon which
his treatment is based are often as much beyond the knowledge
of those who have not been instructed in the science
of medicine, as a strictly metaphysical argument is beyond
the knowledge, and therefore the criticism, of a plain unlearned
audience.</p>

<p>A similar defect can be pointed out in the analogy of the
case of the juggler. However much he felt embarrassed
by the keen eye which he was conscious was watching him,
he knew that if the way in which his feats were performed
was discovered, his skill would nevertheless be appreciated
and admired. The physician, as you have seen, has
no consolation of this kind. He knows that those who
watch him have generally so little knowledge of disease,
and of its treatment, that they cannot estimate with any
correctness the skill with which he meets the various phases
presented by disease, with its numerous and changing complications;
and yet they are quite confident that they are
exactly right in their judgment on such points. He is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
watched by ignorance, and ignorance, too, believing itself to
be wise.</p>

<p>And farther, as the clergyman, if he be one, who, instead
of possessing true eloquence, is skilled in the mere tricks of
oratory, would prefer an ignorant and indiscriminating
audience, and fears one of an opposite character; and as
a bungling juggler had rather be watched by unskilful than
skilful eyes; so the ignorant and dishonorable physician is
more at home, when the eyes of the multitude are fixed
upon him, than when he is under the scrutiny of his medical
brethren. And as many, who are incapable of being
real orators, study most faithfully the tricks of oratory, and
so far succeed as to deceive the superficial and the ignorant,
so there is many a physician, who, instead of bestowing all
his energies upon the management of disease, wastes them
in learning the tricks of the charlatan, which will enable
him, like the mock orator, to make a show of skill and
acquire the reputation of possessing it with the multitude.
This he can do with more certainty than the pretender in
oratory, because he deals with subjects on which most men
are profoundly ignorant, and yet think themselves to be
very wise. It is for this reason, that the quackish physician,
in common with the open quack, addresses all his
appeals to the multitude, and brings all his arts to bear upon
the one point of making such false displays as will impress
upon their minds the idea that he has uncommon knowledge
and skill. He therefore loves their credulous gaze, while he
hates the intelligent scrutiny of his brethren. There is no
one thing, in which the difference between the empirical
and dishonorable physician and the high-minded and
truly skilful practitioner is more strongly marked than in
this.</p>

<p>The practice, then, of interfering with physicians in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
performance of their duties, which is so common in every
community, impairs their usefulness, not only directly,
by embarrassing them in their treatment of the sick, but
also indirectly, by encouraging the intrigues and manœuvres
of the dishonorable in our profession. We have no
hope of persuading busy-bodies to abandon a practice of
which they are so fond; but we have a right to expect, that
the wise and good, who are so often betrayed into it by zeal
for some favorite physician, or remedy, or by a generous
kindness, or an urgent anxiety for the patient, will, upon
seeing their error, renounce it, and pursue in future such a
course as will secure to the sick the best efforts of the physician
in their behalf.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE MUTUAL INFLUENCE OF MIND AND BODY IN DISEASE.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Many seem to think that when the body is sick, it is simply
a sickness of the body alone, and the mind has nothing
to do with it. They do indeed allow that when actual
mental derangement occurs in connection with any disease
the mind is affected with the body; but they are prone to
lose sight of the fact in all ordinary cases of disease, and
yet it exists in these as really, though not to the same degree.
The influence of disease upon the mind is obvious to the
most careless and superficial observer, when he sees the
delirium produced by inflammation of the brain; but such
cases seem to him to stand out as glaring exceptions to what
he considers the great general fact—that the mind is independent
of the ailments of the body. Physicians themselves
too often overlook the influence of mind in their treatment
of disease, and the community generally have very inadequate
views of its extent and universality. There can not
be any sickness of the body, however slight, that does not
produce some effect upon the mind, and which is not
influenced either for good or for ill through mental impressions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p>It is important in the management of the sick, not only
that this fact should be kept clearly and steadily in view by
the physician; but that it should be understood by the community,
so that the efforts of the physician may not be thwarted,
as they often are, by the attendants and friends of the sick,
when he aims to act upon bodily disease by impressions
made on the mind. And I refer not in this remark merely
to impressions of this kind where the attempt to produce
them is so palpable that the most careless observer would
perceive it, but to all those influences which the physician
is exerting upon the minds of the sick, in his daily intercourse
with them. In truth, everything that he says and
does in the sick room, is to be regarded as really a medicine,
and producing as real if not as manifest effects upon the
state of the patient, as any of the drugs that he administers.</p>

<p>It will be profitable, then, to the general reader, as well as
to the medical man, to examine the influences which the
mind and the body exert upon each other in sickness, the
use which can be made of such influences in the cure of
disease, and the abuse to which they are liable from the
mismanagement of those who have the care of the sick.</p>

<p>Before doing this, however, it may be both interesting
and profitable to look at the connection which exists between
the body and the mind. There are various figures used to
illustrate this connection. The most common one is that
in which the mind is spoken of as dwelling in the body as
a habitation. In a certain sense this is true. This tabernacle
of flesh, as the Bible aptly terms it, is, in its present
state a habitation, which the mind is to leave in a short
time, to return to it, however, at length, rebuilt and refitted
in a more glorious, an incorruptible form, to dwell in it then
forever. But this illustration of the mysterious connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
of the mind with the body is but a <em>partial</em> one—it does not
express the extent nor the intimacy of that connection. The
mind is not a mere dweller put into this habitation. Its
union with it is not thus loose and easily severed. It is
bound to its every nerve and fibre, so that the least touch
of the body at any point affects the mind. Instead of being
put into the body, it has, being thus interlaced, as we may
say, fibre with fibre, grown with its growth, and strengthened
with its strength. In the feebleness of infancy the mind is
just as feeble as the body, and they both grow together up
to the vigor and firmness of manhood, and both decline
together in old age. So close is their union through all the
stages of life, and so equally is each affected by the joys
and sufferings of the other, that we might justly conclude
that at death, when the tabernacle crumbles into dust, the
mind falls with it never to rise again, had not a divine revelation
told us that, indissoluble as this connection appears
during life, almighty power will dissever it and release the
soul from the thousand ties that bind it to its habitation at
the very moment of its destruction. Were it not for this
assurance of our immortality, we could look forward in the
uncertain future to nothing but blank, drear annihilation, as
awaiting our minds, just as it does the minds of the brutes
that perish.</p>

<p>In our carefulness to avoid materialism, we are too apt
to look upon the mind and the body as two separate and
independent things. At death they do indeed become so,
but who of us knows that they would, were it not for the
fiat of the Almighty? Who knows that there is not a
necessity for the putting forth of his power in each individual
case at the time of death, to prevent the mind of
man from dying with his body, just as the mind of the brute
does with his? The very prevalent notion that the mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
is <em>essentially</em> indestructible, and that it is put into the body
as a separate thing, having the power <em>of itself</em> to leave the
body whenever it dies, rests on no substantial proof. That
it is <em>destined</em> thus to leave the body is quite another thing.</p>

<p>Materialists, of whom we are pained to say there are
many among believers in phrenology, though they flatly
deny it,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> seem to think that the brain produces thought
pretty much as the liver makes bile or the stomach gastric
juice. This doctrine would be <em>gratuitous</em>, a mere supposition,
even if there were no Christian revelation to contradict
it. But while we discard all such anti-Christian and absurd
fantasies, we must not run to the other extreme, as some
good men have done. It must be admitted, that in this life
all the <em>manifestations</em> of mind are not only connected with,
but are <em>dependent</em> upon, a material organization. The
nature of this connection and dependence is of course a
mystery, but of its existence there is no doubt. So far as
injury is done to the brain and nervous system, just so far
are the manifestations or actions of the mind impaired.
And, on the other hand, moral causes, acting <em>directly</em> upon
the mind, affect through it the organization. And when
insanity results from moral causes thus acting, it is not a
direct effect, but an <em>indirect</em> one—the organization affected
by the mind is thrown into a diseased state, and reacts upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
the mind, influencing its manifestations. If the mind thus
acted upon were a spirit, separated from the body, the result
would be merely the feelings, which the motives applied
would <em>naturally</em> produce, and not the unnatural feelings of
insanity. It is not strictly proper then to speak of a ‘mind
diseased.’</p>

<p>Let me not be understood to mean that mental derangement
in every case is to be attributed to disease that leaves
such palpable traces that the dissecting knife would reveal
it if death were to take place. There are diseased operations
in the body, that are hidden from our view—so hidden,
that they not only leave no traces, but often develop no
characteristic bodily symptoms.</p>

<p>Although the principles above stated are often overlooked,
and sometimes doubted, or even denied, there are some
cases in which they stand out so plainly, that everybody
acknowledges for the time their truth. For example, if a
man, by a blow on his head, has a piece of his skull pressed
inward upon his brain, he becomes senseless, and, if he
arouse at all from his stupor, his mind is obviously in an
unnatural state. The surgeon raises the depressed bone,
and thus taking off the pressure from the brain, restores the
mind of the man to activity and sanity. In this case it is
plain to every one, that the mental manifestations were
suspended by a cause acting directly upon the material
organization, and that they were revived again by the
removal of this cause.</p>

<p>Take another example. A man of strong and clear
mind becomes deranged, and at length arrives at perfect
idiocy. He goes down to the grave in this condition. No
one supposes that in such a case the mind is affected independently
of the body, but the mental state is of course
attributed to bodily disease; and affection fondly, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
may say rationally, cherishes the expectation, that when
the mind shall be freed from this tabernacle of flesh, it will
emerge from its long night of darkness, and possess again
its faculties in full, just as the man who lies senseless from
pressure upon the brain, is restored to mental activity when
that pressure is taken off by the trephine and elevator of
the surgeon.</p>

<p>Now what is true of the cases that we have cited is true
in every case—all mental aberration, however slight it may
be, results from the connection of the mind with the body,
and would not occur without this connection. It is the
product of some impression made upon the material organization,
either directly, or indirectly through the mind. This
impression may be momentary and evanescent, or it may
produce a real change of structure. It would be interesting
to enlarge upon these points, but it is not necessary
for our purpose.</p>

<p>We speak of the brain as the seat of the mind, or soul.
If we mean by this simply, that this is the great central
organ of that system in the body (the nervous system)
through which the mind acts upon external things, and is
acted upon by them, it is correct so to speak. But if we
mean to localize the mind, as sitting there, and especially
if we fix upon some one part of the brain, as Descartes did
upon the pineal gland (a body smaller than a pea) as the
seat, the throne of the mind, the illustration is an erroneous
one. The mind acts upon the whole body, through all the
parts of the nervous system, and each portion of that system
has its own peculiar offices to perform in obedience to the
mind. This is as true of the brain as it is of the rest of
the nervous system. This organ is a complex one, and the
different parts have their different offices. This we know
in regard to some of these parts, and we can justly presume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
it in regard to others. And we do this without adopting
the fanciful ideas of phrenologists in locating the different
faculties of the mind.</p>

<p>While the brain is the great central organ of the nervous
system, by which the mind imparts and receives impressions,
there are other parts of that same system which seem to
bear some other relation to the mind than that by which
they transmit these impressions to and from the mind
through the brain, as the nerves ordinarily do. They seem
to have a connection with the mind independent of the
direct agency of the brain, and for aught we know they
have such a connection. When the mind is affected by
any passion, either of the cheerful or the depressing kind,
its sensible effects upon the body are not observable chiefly in
the brain, but in the region of the heart and the other organs
adjacent to it. The thrill of joy is felt there, and grief produces
there its sensation of oppression, prompting the occasional
sigh to relieve it.</p>

<p>Such facts as these led an eminent French physiologist,
Bichat, to adopt the theory, that while the intellectual functions
have their seat in the brain, the moral sentiments have
theirs in the ganglionic system of nerves, (as it is called,)
which has certain great nervous centres in the region of
the heart, stomach, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I will not stop to expose the fallacy of this plausible
theory. It is sufficient for my purpose simply to advert to
the fact, that the moral sentiments of the mind or soul are
manifested more in that part of the body than in the brain.
The very language of the affections, and the gestures which
accompany the utterance of that language, or supply its
place when feeling is too big for utterance, are in consonance
with this fact. We speak of the heart, and we
place the hand upon the heart when the moral sentiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
are in lively action. And when feeling is so great as to be
overpowering, or when the attempt is made to suppress it,
there is with the load which is felt at the heart, a sensation
of choking, (no word expresses it so well as this homely
one,) preventing utterance; and then when it finds vent, it
seems as if there was a gushing forth from the heart, not
merely figuratively, but from the material heart that is
throbbing in our bosoms.</p>

<p>The fact which I have been illustrating shows the force
of such expressions in the Bible as ‘bowels of compassion,’
‘bowels did yearn,’ &amp;c. It throws some light also on the
influence of grief upon the stomach, and on the depression
of spirits which so sorely afflicts the dyspeptic.</p>

<p>It gives but a faint idea, then, of the all-pervading connection
of the mind with the body, to suppose the mind to
be locked up in some chamber of the brain, there receiving
by the nerves messages from every quarter, and sending
forth messages in return by the same media. There is no
evidence of the existence of one great central point of
attachment for the mind, but the ties of its connection with
the body are multiplied and diffused. It is not merely,
therefore, positive disease existing in the brain that affects
the mind. Disorder of mind is infinitely modified by the
different seats and modes of disease in different portions of
the nervous system, as well as in different parts of the brain
itself. I speak not now of palpable insanity alone, but of
all the various states of mind occurring in sickness.</p>

<p>One of the most common and prominent characteristics
of the state of mind in sickness, is weakness. The weakness
of body caused by disease is generally accompanied by
a corresponding debility of mind. When Cassius speaks of
Cæsar, as asking, ‘give me some drink, Titinius, as a sick
girl,’ you see something more than weakness of muscle—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
giant <em>mind</em> of the mighty Cæsar is prostrated to effeminacy.</p>

<p>And as weakness of muscle is attended with unsteady,
irregular, and sometimes even spasmodic action of its fibres,
so it is with weakness of mind. Its efforts are fitful, and it is
easily thrown off from its balance. A feeble man tottering
along, occasionally resting upon his staff, or taking hold of
a post or a fence, is thrown down by the gentlest touch, or
by stumbling over even a slight obstacle, that he chances
not to see so as to avoid or guard against it. And in the
tedious journey of sickness, mind and body totter along in
their feebleness together, and either is exceedingly liable to
fall. And if the one fall, the other is pulled down with it.
The guide, therefore, of these two travellers in this journey,
must see to it, that all obstacles in the way of either be
removed or avoided, that no rude hand be permitted to
touch them, and that all those supports be supplied on the
way which either can best use.</p>

<p>The mental weakness which disease occasions, is often
exhibited to the physician under affecting circumstances.
Minds that have been able to grasp the most difficult and
abstruse subjects return, in the debility of sickness, to the
simplest ideas—those which are both common and precious
to the child, the man, the angel, and to God himself. The
‘strong meat’ is turned from, for the ‘milk of babes.’ I
remember one of lofty intellect, fading away with consumption,
who well exemplified this remark. Her aged father
was reading to her a chapter in one of the epistles of Paul.
‘It is good,’ said she, ‘but I cannot understand it now. It
bewilders me. Something more simple—something from
the Apostle John is better for my poor feeble mind.’</p>

<p>The mind, weakened by disease, is easily disturbed and
agitated, except in those cases in which disease blunts the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
sensibilities. Derangement of mind is often the product of
mere weakness, under increase of excitement, without any
fresh accession of local disease. A familiar illustration of
this you may see in fever. Very often there is mental
derangement only during the paroxysm of fever, the mind
being quite clear in the remissions. Especially is this the
case with children, whose sensibilities and sympathies are
in so much more lively a state than those of the adult.</p>

<p>Slight causes, therefore, which would produce little or no
effect upon the mind of one in firm health, may affect
strongly the mind of a sick man. A single example will
suffice. The patient was sick with typhus fever. He had
been very much deranged, and great care had been taken
to guard against any excitement, which might act injuriously
upon him. He was now getting better, and his mind
had become calm and clear, though still, like his body, it
was very weak. A friend came in one morning as usual
to inquire about him. He knew that all visitors had been
prohibited from going into the sick room, but he wished
very much to see his friend, and, as he had an opportunity,
he looked in through the door, as it chanced to be a little
open. The dull eye of the sick man saw him dimly, and
he at once became as much affected as if he had seen a
dreadful vision. His distempered fancy conjured up ideas
of a painful character, which remained upon his mind for a
week, and endangered as well as delayed his convalescence.</p>

<p>This incident leads me to remark that physicians find
great difficulty in securing a due degree of quietness in the
sick room. I use the word quietness in its widest sense.
I do not mean the avoidance of noise merely, but of all
improper excitement. Visiting is generally a nuisance
in the chamber of sickness. Multitudes of lives are continually
sacrificed to curiosity and mistaken kindness. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
tattling circles that gather round the fireside of the sick
room, and retail their mixtures of medical lore, and slander,
and hair-breadth escapes, and wonderful cures, often inflict
torture upon the shattered nerves of the poor patient, and
that torture sometimes, I have not a doubt, ends in death,
when a recovery might otherwise have taken place.</p>

<p>No one should enter the sick room from curiosity or from
a mere vague desire to do good. Nothing but the actual
prospect of doing good should prompt him to go there.
Indeed, everything which interferes with the proper quiet
of the sick should be most scrupulously avoided. It should
always be remembered, that in many cases of disease, mental
excitement may do as much harm as the excitement
produced by stimulating medicines. And it is as much the
business of the physician to direct in the management of
this matter, as in the administration of remedies; for it has
as real, if not as great a bearing on the recovery of the
patient. Indeed, sometimes it is vastly more important
than all the medicine that is given in the case. I call to
mind a case which illustrates this last remark so strikingly,
that I will state it as briefly as possible. A patient was
taken sick, with some important business pressing upon his
attention at the time of the attack. He was persuaded to
dismiss it entirely from his thoughts for the time. He was
soon relieved by the remedies that were used, and he was
in a fair way for a recovery. He was, however, in such a
state, that it was very important that he should be kept
from all excitement, and as I saw that he was disposed to
do the business now with some friend, whom he wished to
have called in for the purpose, I told him and his family in
plain terms the risk which he would run if he should pursue
this course. He however disregarded my injunctions,
and the consequence was that in the evening of the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
day he was very sick, and in a few days died from disease
in the brain, which was clearly induced by the mental excitement.
If he had followed my directions as scrupulously
in regard to this point as he did in regard to the medicines
which were given, recovery instead of death would probably
have been the result.</p>

<p>Some in their anxiety to secure the quiet of the sick, go
to an extreme, and give almost the silence of the grave to
every sick room. They institute a sort of prison discipline,
and shut out both the light of heaven and all cheerfulness
of intercourse. The very means which they take to produce
quietness, the stealthy step and the whisper, are apt to
disturb the patient more than noise or excitement would do.
Discretion should be exercised by the physician, and the
friends of the patient should rely on him to direct this part
of the management of the case, as well as that which is
strictly medical. He must judge as to the degree and kind
of excitement appropriate to the case, and direct in its
application, for the same reason that he should, in a case of
disease of the eye, direct as to the amount of light which
should be admitted to it.</p>

<p>It is often very difficult to carry out these principles,
especially in families that have but a small number of apartments.
The fear of giving offense, too, very often opens the
door wide for visitors, against the most positive injunctions
of the physician. To obviate this difficulty, I have in some
few cases put upon the door a card, forbidding this kind of
intrusion—an expedient which I have found to be very successful.
One case was that of a clergyman’s family. So
many were sick, that the house was a perfect hospital. A
large portion of the parish poured in of course, to offer their
sympathy and their services. Most of these persons did
more harm than good. I attempted to remedy the evil by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
directions to the nurses, and by conversation with individuals,
but in vain. At length I put up a card on the door
of the house, to this effect: ‘Visitors are requested to go
directly into the parlor. No one is to enter the sick rooms
but those who have the care of the sick. No talking in the
entry.’ This effected the desired change at once. I introduce
this case simply to show the difficulties which exist on
this point, especially in country towns, and the very plain
remedy which can be applied. There is no reason why a
universal rule should not be adopted in every case in which
it is deemed necessary by the physician.</p>

<p>The attendants on the sick often make a great mistake
in supposing the patient to be so fast asleep, or so stupid, as
to receive no impressions from their conversation. Often,
from this cause, he is obliged to hear what may do him
great harm. Amid the confused thoughts of his dreary bewildered
state of mind, the idea of his own death is conjured
up by some remark, to trouble and affright him.
Instead of getting the rest which his wearied body and mind so
much need, his nerves are disturbed by the hum of conversation,
and his mind is harrassed by a succession of dread
thoughts and visions, suggested by remarks, of which it is
supposed that he takes no cognizance.</p>

<p>Some, who are very cautious on these points in regard to
adults, never think of their application to children. Often,
for example, does the physician find, on entering the sick
room, those whom kindness and curiosity have assembled
there, talking loudly, while the mother is trying in vain to
soothe the troubled child by rocking the cradle as if for a
wager. Much, too, is often said in presence of sick children
that ought not to be, on the false supposition that they
do not understand what is said. Many a child is frightened
by horrid stories, and by gloomy comments upon his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
case. Visitors stand over him, and besides fretting him by
their staring, they say something, perhaps, of this sort.
‘Poor thing! how sick he looks! I don’t believe he can get
well.’ And then they go on to tell about some little child,
perhaps his playmate, that had died recently, and whom,
perhaps, he saw laid in his grave, and utter in his hearing,
with all due solemnity and sorrowfulness, the opinion that
he is affected much like him, and will probably die in the
same way; adding, by way of consolation to the poor mother,
that then they will be in heaven together. Children
have sensibilities and hopes and fears, like adults, and they
understand, even at a very tender age, enough about death
to be affected, and often very strongly, by this holding up
of its grim visage directly before them. The mind, and the
nervous system, by which the mind is connected with the
body, are as excitable in the child as in the adult, and the
avoidance of unnecessary alarm and excitement is as important
in the sickness of the one as in that of the other.</p>

<p>I cannot forbear here to notice one thing, which often
exerts a bad influence upon the mind of the child in sickness.
It is the habit which many people have of threatening
their children, when in health, with sending for the
doctor to bleed them, or to give them some bitter medicine, as
a punishment for their misdeeds. The inevitable tendency
of this is to increase the mental depression and agitation
which disease produces, by the gloomy associations which
are thus necessarily attached to sickness in the mind of the
child. The physician should never be held up as a bugbear
to children, but should uniformly be spoken of in their
presence in such terms, that when he visits them in sickness
they may rejoice to see him, both as a friend and as one
who is to bring them relief. There is no doubt that many
a child is seized with an ill-defined terror, when the physician<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
is called in, and thinks of him only as some dreadful
monster that cuts off children’s ears, and gashes their flesh
almost for sport. The effect of such a feeling on the weakened
and agitated nerves is always injurious and undoubtedly
is sometimes fatally so. One may get some adequate
idea of the feelings of children under such circumstances,
by imagining himself, in a state of weakness and disease, to
be visited by an incarnate demon, who has both the power
and the disposition to torment him.</p>

<p>I am anxious to impress most faithfully the mind of the
reader with the importance of giving rest to the mind in
sickness. I have already remarked on the extent and the
intimacy of the union between the mind and the body. It
is never to be forgotten in the chamber of sickness, that the
mind not only is not by itself, alone and independent, but
that it is not connected with sound nerves, but acts upon a
deranged body, and is acted upon by it, through the multitude
of nervous filaments, which, scattered everywhere, are
receiving impressions at every point, and transmitting them
to the mind. If, therefore, the mind, thus disturbed by disease,
be at the same time troubled by causes applied directly
to it, the result must be a reaction from the mind through
the nerves upon the disease itself. The mental and the
bodily irritations must increase each other. It is then just
as important to withhold all irritating causes from the mind,
as from the diseased organ. For example, if the brain be
inflamed, that inflammation may be aggravated as certainly
by exciting the mind, as it would be by the administration
of any stimulant to the body. In either case the same
result occurs—the brain is stimulated—the only difference
is in the channel through which it comes. And it is the
duty of the physician to shut out the irritation from one
channel, as much as from the other. When the eye is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
inflamed, one part of the curative means is to exclude the
light, because the light, by exciting the nerve of sight, would
increase the inflammation. But the action of the mind is
as really connected with the brain and nervous system, as
the act of vision is with the eye; and therefore it must
be guarded against, in inflammation of the brain, as vision
is in inflammation of the eye. The same may be said, to
some extent, at least, of every other part as well as the brain,
for every organ is supplied with nerves connecting it with
the mind.</p>

<p>As an illustration of these remarks, I will introduce a
case, showing the influence of the irritation of passion upon
a diseased body. I refer to the death of John Hunter, who
has been often called the greatest anatomist and physiologist
of his age. “On October 16, 1793,” says his biographer,
“when in his usual state of health, he went to St.
George’s hospital, and, unexpectedly meeting with some
things that ruffled his temper, he allowed himself to give
way to passion; the heart became overloaded with blood,
the ossified aorta, not yielding to the effort of the heart, the
countenance became dark, angina pectoris immediately
ensued, and turning round to Dr. Robertson, one of the
physicians of the hospital, he was incapable of utterance,
and died.”</p>

<p>This, it is true, is an extraordinary case; but the result
of mental irritation in common cases of disease, though not
as great and as palpable as in this case, is nevertheless as
real. While it caused in the case of John Hunter a sudden
and final suspension of the heart’s action, it would, in
a man suffering from some inflammation, aggravate that
disease, by driving the blood too forcibly into the inflamed
part, and by making its irritable nerves partake of the general
excitement of the system. The effect might not be at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
any moment very powerful, but if the irritation be repeated
or continued, although it may be vastly less in amount
than it was in the case of Hunter, the accumulative effect
of the excitement upon the disease would at length become
very great, perhaps destructive. And in certain low states
of disease, when, in the midst of great weakness, the nervous
system is in an extremely agitated condition—a condition,
in which little causes may produce powerful effects—a
comparatively slight irritation induced in the mind,
connected as it is with every trembling filament of that
nervous system, may overwhelm the very powers of life as
certainly, if not as suddenly, as did the strong passion of
Hunter, in overloading his diseased heart, and thus stopping
its action.</p>

<p>But withholding irritation, and securing rest and quiet,
do not comprise all the physician’s duty in relation to the
mind, any more than they do in relation to the body of the
patient. He is sometimes to excite the mind to positive
action, for the same reasons that exciting medicines are
sometimes administered to the body; and he may thus
often exert, through the mind, a very happy influence upon
disease. This remedy, as I have already hinted, is to be
applied with discretion, according to the nature of each
case, and so as not to interfere with that rest, which I
have shown to be so necessary to the mind in the treatment
of disease. The excitement must, with some few
exceptions, be agreeable in character, in order that it may
produce a genial influence upon the nervous system. The
mode, the time and the degree of its application require the
exercise of discrimination, as much as the dose, and form,
and time of any stimulant or other medicine that is given
to the patient. The judgment and tact of the physician
are never more needed than upon such points as these.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
Tissot, a French physician, relates an amusing case, showing
the utility of discrimination in regard to the kind of
mental stimulation to be applied. A lady was affected
with a lethargy, and many applications were used to rouse
her, but to no purpose. At length a person, who knew
that the love of money was the ruling passion of her soul,
put some French crowns into her hand. After a few
minutes she opened her eyes, and was soon entirely aroused
from her stupor.</p>

<p>The influence of the imagination upon the body is
familiar to every one. I will mention a few cases to show
its power.</p>

<p>Beddoes, an English physician of great enthusiasm, had
imbibed, among other new ideas, the notion that palsy could
be cured by inhaling nitrous oxide gas. He requested
that eminent chemist, Sir Humphrey Davy, to administer
the gas to one of his patients, and sent him to him for that
purpose. Sir Humphrey put the bulb of a thermometer
under the tongue of the paralytic, to ascertain the temperature
of the body, so that he might see whether it would be
at all affected by the inhalation of the gas. The sick man,
filled with faith from the assurances of the ardent Dr. Beddoes,
and supposing that the thermometer was the remedy,
declared at once that he felt better. Davy, desirous of seeing
how much imagination would do in such a case, then
told him that enough had been done for that time, and
directed him to come the next day. The application of
the thermometer was made from day to day in the same
way, and in a fortnight the man was cured.</p>

<p>When Perkins’ tractors were in vogue, Dr. Haygarth of
Bath, as I have stated in another chapter, had a pair of
wooden ones made of precisely the same shape with the
orthodox metallic ones, and contrived to color them so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
the deception should not be discovered. He then applied
them to quite a number of patients, with the same results
that followed the use of the genuine tractors, which cost five
guineas a pair. Pain was relieved as if by magic, and the
lame were made to walk. Their operation in these cases
is of course to be accounted for in the same way with the
operation of the thermometer in the case just related.</p>

<p>Some medical students determined to try the influence
of imagination upon a countryman who was going into
town to market. They met him one after the other, each
telling him how pale and sick he looked. At first, as he
felt perfectly well, he paid no regard to it, but after two or
three had thus accosted him, he began to think there must
be something the matter with him. By the influence of
imagination he soon began to feel badly, and to look really
pale. And as he still continued to meet persons, who
declared themselves struck with his peculiarly sickly and
ghastly appearance, he grew worse, and the result was that
he sickened and died.</p>

<p>I could cite numerous cases illustrative of the influence
of the imagination upon the condition of the body, but
these will suffice.</p>

<p>The physician has constant opportunities for making use
of the influence of mental <em>association</em> to much advantage
in the management of the sick. He does this almost insensibly
in his daily intercourse with his patients, exciting
trains of agreeable associations in their minds, varied to
suit the mental and moral character of each, thus aiding
materially the operation of his remedies.</p>

<p>Dr. Rush gives a striking instance of the influence of
association, which I will relate in his own words: “During
the time,” says he, “that I passed in a country school in
Cecil county, in Maryland, I often went on a holiday with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
my schoolmates to see an eagle’s nest, upon the summit of
a dead tree in the neighborhood of the school, during the
time of the incubation of that bird. The daughter of the
farmer in whose field this tree stood, and with whom I
became acquainted, married and settled in this city about
forty years ago. In our occasional interviews, we now and
then spoke of the innocent haunts and rural pleasures of
our youth, and, among other things, of the eagle’s nest in
her father’s field. A few years ago I was called to visit this
woman, in consultation with a young physician, in the
lowest stage of a typhus fever. Upon entering the room I
caught her eye, and with a cheerful tone of voice said only,
<em>the eagle’s nest</em>. She seized my hand without being able to
speak, and discovered strong emotions of pleasure in her
countenance, probably from a sudden association of all her
early domestic connections and enjoyments with the words
I had uttered. From that time she began to recover. She
is now living, and seldom fails, when we meet, to salute me
with the echo of <em>the eagle’s nest</em>.”</p>

<p>It is important in the treatment of disease, to remove all
causes which awaken disagreeable associations in the minds
of the sick, for they often retard, and sometimes prevent
the recovery of the patient. It is as clearly the duty of the
physician to detect the causes of such associations, and to
remove them if possible, as it is to detect and remove the
material causes of any irritation or inflammation.</p>

<p>Dr. Rush mentions a case that came under his observation,
in which the influence of disagreeable associations
hindered the recovery of the patient. “A gentleman in
this city,” he says, “contracted a violent and dangerous
fever by gunning. After being cured of it, he did not get
well. His gun stood in the corner of his room, and being
constantly in sight, kept up in his mind the distressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
remembrance of his sickness and danger. Upon removing
it out of his room he soon recovered.”</p>

<p>Some are much more readily affected by mental associations
than others. A gentleman in a stage coach was
observed to keep his cloak lying by his side, while he was
shivering with the cold. He was asked by one of his fellow
travellers why he did not put it on. He replied, ‘I have
just returned from a voyage, in which I was very sea-sick,
and while so I lay with that cloak wrapped around me.
Foolish as it may seem, I cannot put it on without renewing
the nausea.’</p>

<p>The various degrees and modes in which mental associations
appear in the sick room, require of course the exercise
of discretion and tact, in managing them to good purpose.
There is often much injury done by failure in this respect.
If, for example, the patient have great irritability of stomach,
and if some medicine which has been doing him good, at
length become exceedingly offensive to him, the continuance
of that medicine might do him essential harm, by the mere
influence of mental association; though, aside from this, it
may be still an exceedingly appropriate remedy for his
disease. Under such circumstances a change must be
made, or the patient will be injured, it may be fatally. It
will not do to call the patient whimsical, and to go right on
with the course. The mental association connected with
the medicine is practically one of the <em>ingredients</em> in it, and
as such has so modified its nature as to render it inappropriate
to the case.</p>

<p>The physician can often do much in curing disease by
<em>diverting</em> the mind of his patient. Disease is frequently
broken up by producing a new action in the system. This
is a principle in medical practice which is familiar to others,
as well as to the physician. And this change may sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
be brought about in the system, by a corresponding
change effected in the mind, especially in those cases where
the state of the mind is particularly influenced by the disease.
The husband of a poor woman, who in a feeble state
of health had fallen into a settled melancholy, broke his
thigh. The whole current of her thoughts and feelings was
now diverted into another channel, from her own sorrows
to the care of him and the relief of his pains, and she
recovered her sanity, and with it, for the most part, her
health, long before the fracture was united. The misfortune
of her husband was a severe remedy, but an effectual one.</p>

<p>A physician of my acquaintance some years since became
thoroughly impressed with the idea, that some symptoms
which he had, indicated the existence of an organic disease
which was certain to end fatally. At his request I made a
full examination of his case, and found the symptoms to be
purely of a nervous character. The expression of my
opinion relieved him for the time of his anxiety. But as
he brooded over his feelings when alone, the same idea
returned again. I examined him repeatedly with the same
result, but the comfort which he received from me was only
temporary. Knowing that he was paying his addresses to
a lady who was not only cheerful herself, but who had the
power of making every body else cheerful about her, I
recommended to him to be married at once, and told him
that if he would be, we never should hear any more about
his aneurism. My prescription was followed, and was
entirely successful. The idea, which had so long haunted
him like an evil spirit, was cast out never to return.</p>

<p>Every one is familiar with the fact, to which I have
already alluded, that dyspepsia has a depressing influence
upon the mind. And as the mental depression reacting
upon the disease aggravates it, anything which tends to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
remove this depression assists materially in curing the disease.
Diversion of the mind from its habitual gloomy ideas
to cheerful thoughts and efforts, often exerts a great influence
in such cases. I will mention a single case illustrative
of this remark. A gentleman of high intellectual character,
who was sadly afflicted with the dyspepsia, visited his friend
Dr. Ives of New Haven, and placed himself under his care.
The Doctor saw at once that medicines would do but little
good in his case, so long as his mind remained in the same
condition, and occupied with the same thoughts; and that
a change there would go far to effect a corresponding one
in his bodily condition. He determined to produce this
change without the patient’s being aware of his intention,
as it in this way would be more effectually accomplished.
In one of his rides with him they alighted to pick some
wild flowers. He adroitly excited his friend’s curiosity in
regard to the structure and growth of the flowers, and
leading his mind on step by step, he did not stop till he had
fairly made him a student of botany without his knowing
it. The result was that he engaged in the study with great
enthusiasm, and followed it up for some time. He was
changed at once from a gloomy self-tormentor into an
ardent and cheerful seeker after knowledge in one of its
richest and fairest fields, and this change made his recovery
a rapid and easy one.</p>

<p>But it is not only in those cases in which the mind is
obviously affected, that the physician is to apply the principle
of which we have just been speaking. He can make
use of it with much profit in ordinary cases of disease, in
his intercourse with his patients from day to day. The
sick are prone to brood over their own complaints, and to
watch their sensations, and they need to have the mind
diverted to other subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>In this connection I will notice very briefly the influence
of change of scene upon the invalid. When the same
objects are seen by him from day to day, and he has the
same subjects of thought and conversation, these all act as
so many fastenings, or points of attachment, tending to
hold the disease in the same unvarying condition. But
take him away from them all, and set him free from this
discouraging and burdensome sameness, and let his thoughts
and feelings flow into other channels, and the change of
course favors the introduction of a new state of things,
bodily as well as mentally. The new objects that he sees
not only take off his attention from his diseased sensations,
but the new excitement that he feels, as he sees them one
after another, diffuses a refreshing and invigorating influence
throughout his system. And imagination lends her
aid in producing this effect. It seems to him that everything
is better than it was where he was so lately shut up
with the feeling almost of a prisoner—that the air is more
pure, the grass more green, the foliage of the trees more
dense and rich, and even the sun more cheerfully bright.
Something, it is true, is to be attributed to change of air
under such circumstances, but much less commonly than
to the influence of change of scene upon the mind.</p>

<p>The sick room, as every physician has frequent occasion
to witness, acquires after a time a monotony that is dreary
and painful to the confined invalid. Day after day he sees
the same furniture and same walls, every irregularity of
whose surface he becomes acquainted with, and he is forced
to seek for some variety even in the most trivial circumstances.
“There, Doctor,” said an invalid playfully, “I
have made a little change, to-day. I have had the rocking-chair
put the other side of the fire-place, and the bureau
moved to that corner, and those phials on the shelf, you see,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
have changed their places. My friends, Cologne and Camphor,
have gone to the other side of that vase, and those
drops (which, by the way, Doctor, I think that I have taken
so long that some <em>change</em> would be well) have their station
now quite at the other end of the shelf. And my good
grandmother, you see, looks down upon me from the other
side of the room. Variety is pleasing, Doctor, even within
a few yards square, when one can not get any farther.”</p>

<p>Even when the invalid is not confined to the sick chamber,
but has his rides and his walks, the monotony of every
day’s routine becomes a weariness. And no wonder that
an escape from this is so often so manifestly beneficial to
him.</p>

<p>But it is not merely the diversion of mind, attendant
upon change of scene, that benefits the invalid, but his
release from those mental associations, that have so tenaciously
connected themselves with his sickness, has an important
influence. The place where he has spent wearisome
days and nights of pain and restlessness and languor,
must necessarily have unpleasant associations connected
with it. These hinder, and in some cases even prevent
convalescence; and when he casts them off, he feels that
he has rid himself of a great burden, and as he goes on his
course with a light heart, a fresh impulse is given to the
vital powers of his body, making him to feel, as he says that
he does, like a new man.</p>

<p>The mind of the sick man sometimes gets into a fixed,
unvaried state, with one settled cast to its ideas. The tendency
of this is to make the diseased condition of body to
remain fixed also. It is important, therefore, to alter this
mental state—to break up this unvarying train of thought
and feeling. There are different ways of doing this in the
different cases that present, and the physician must judge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
as to the most proper mode of effecting the object in each
case. I will give a few cases as illustrations.</p>

<p>A patient who had been very sick, but who had recovered
from the severity of her attack, and who was in a fair
way for getting well, remained precisely in the same condition
for some time. Her mind was in a fixed state of gloom,
marked by a perfectly unvaried expression of countenance.
Her friends had tried in every way to make her cheerful, but
it was in vain, for the simple reason that all their attempts
to do so were obvious. I knew that she had naturally a
lively sense of the ludicrous, and therefore, after getting her
somewhat off her guard by some incidental conversation, I
then, with an air of perfect carelessness, uttered something
which I thought would be very apt to hit her mirthfulness,
as the phrenologists term it. It did so, and a smile kindled
up at once upon her sad countenance. The spell was now
fairly broken. She speedily regained her wonted cheerfulness,
and the load being cast off, she went straight on in
the bright road of convalescence. In this case it was but
a small thing, after all, that turned the current of thought
and feeling, and the means which had already been used,
most persons would suppose, were much better calculated
to do it. All direct and palpable efforts to make the gloomy
invalid cheerful, are almost always unsuccessful; and yet it
is such efforts that are most commonly made use of by the
friends of the sick.</p>

<p>The course which was pursued in another case, was quite
a different one. The patient was a clergyman, who had
the impression strongly fastened upon his mind that he
should certainly die, and could not be made to admit by
the force of any reasoning, the possibility even of his recovery.
It was not an opinion founded upon evidence, but
it was a fixed state of mind, which was the product of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
disease. It was important to remove, if possible, this all-absorbing
thought, for it was reacting unfavorably upon
the disease itself. It could not be done by argument, nor
by speaking to him the words of hope; for it was not a conviction
of truth arrived at by any reasoning, but an impression
unaccountable, but strong and vivid. He did not <em>think</em>
that he should die, but he <em>felt</em> that he <em>knew</em> it. Some remedy,
then, different from either of these, was necessary. As
he was a man of stern, decided religious principle, I determined
to make a bold onset in that quarter. I told him
that God alone knew whether he would die or recover, and
that he was doing wrong—absolutely committing high-handed
sin, in setting himself up as knowing what God
only knows. This was the substance of what I said to
him, and it produced the desired effect. The impression
was dislodged from his mind, and though he occasionally
talked discouragingly of the result of his sickness, he never
said after that, that he <em>knew</em> that he should die.</p>

<p>One other case I will relate, in which the course taken
to destroy the diseased mental impression was of still a different
character. A patient, a gentleman of superior mental
and moral qualities, sent for me to inform me that he
had received a revelation, in which God had forbidden him
to eat or drink or sleep. The confidence which he manifested
in me by sending for me determined in my mind at
once the course to be pursued. I told him that I had also
had a revelation, which was quite as good as his, perhaps
better. ‘And,’ said I, assuming the air of calm authority
that expects submission as a matter of course, ‘you must
obey it.’ ‘What is your revelation,’ he inquired. ‘My
revelation,’ said I, ‘embraces all that is necessary in your
case. And in obedience to it you must continue to follow
my directions, and you must eat and drink and sleep as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
have done.’ I left him with my revelation fastened in his
mind, it having supplanted his altogether, and he immediately
ate and drank, and that night slept as well as he
usually did.</p>

<p>In chronic cases especially, the sick are often prevented
from recovering by the influence of unpleasant circumstances
in their situation, or in their relation to others
around them. The friends of the sick often get out of patience
with them in the tediousness of a long confinement.
Sometimes there is unkindness, and this to the weakened
mind and depressed spirits of the invalid, is often a burden
that cannot be borne. Some secret grief often neutralizes
the influence of medicine.</p>

<p>There is often great want of tact in managing the whims
and caprices of the sick. Many expect them to be as reasonable
in their notions and desires and feelings as if they
were well. It is unwarrantable and unjust to demand this
of a weakened and beclouded mind, and agitated nerves.
Trifles light as air affect the sick strongly. The very grasshopper
is a burden to them. It is with the mind of a sick
man as it is with his senses. Noise troubles him—even
the motion of a rocking-chair, perhaps, or the swinging of
a foot, disturbs his sight, and through that sense disturbs his
mind. The darling child, whom he delights, when he is
well, to see running about playing his little pranks, must be
taken out of the room, because he makes his father’s head to
whirl and to ache. Thus easily is he disturbed through the
senses. Just so is it with his mind—it is as easily disturbed,
and circumstances, which would scarcely excite a passing
thought in health, now agitate and depress him. Disappointments,
that ordinarily would be felt but for a moment
and slightly, he can hardly brook now. Every mother has
often seen how easily her child is grieved by little things,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
when mind as well as body is prostrated by sickness. And
she does not commonly get out of patience with it for its
seemingly unreasonable griefs, but soothes and quiets them.
It would be well if the attendants and friends of the sick
had more of that patience and forbearance, which are
prompted by a mother’s tenderness.</p>

<p>The sick often contract a strong feeling of dislike towards
some things, and sometimes towards individuals. They
may regret it, and see that it is unfounded and foolish, and
yet not be able to get rid of it. Some make the sick dislike
them by their very kindness, because it is so officious and
pains-taking. There is a tact in the good and judicious
nurse which dictates just what to do and how much, and
many of the attendants on the sick are sadly deficient in
this.</p>

<p>The fretfulness and impatience of contradiction, which
are so often the product of the nervousness of disease, are
generally not to be combatted, but to be borne with. The
considerations which I have already presented clearly show
the propriety of this maxim; and yet it is a maxim which
is very commonly neglected. Many a dispute about the
most trivial things is held between the patient and the attendant
or friend, when a little tact might have diverted the
weakened mind from the subject, without yielding in the
least anything, which pride of opinion or firmness would
prompt to hold fast to. I once heard a mother, a woman
of intelligence too, dispute with her sick daughter about the
number of crackers she had eaten during the day, each
maintaining her side of the question with as much zeal and
pertinacity, as if it were a matter of vital importance. The
result was that the patient was injuriously agitated by this
rencontre about nothing, and ended it by bursting into tears,
and the mother triumphed, as was her wont to do, by having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
the last word. And this was a fair specimen of the
moral management of that patient during a long sickness.
It added vastly to her nervousness, and clouded a mind filled
with lofty, and refined, and tender sentiment, and made that
chamber a scene of painful exhibition of thought and feeling,
when a different management might have soothed her
agitated nerves, and left the sensitive chords of her soul to
respond clearly and harmoniously to the gentle touch of
friendship and love.</p>

<p>The patient often feels, and takes comfort in feeling, that
his temporary outbursts of fretfulness and impatience are
understood by his friends, as having no consonance with
the real feelings of his heart. A much respected patient,
of whose sickness I have many pleasant recollections, was
one day speaking to me of his sister in the highest terms of
eulogy. “Yet,” said he, “I scold at her, but I have no
business to do it. However, she understands it. She knows
that I am nervous, and that I am sometimes hardly myself
and she forgives it all.”</p>

<p>Let me not be understood to mean that all the notions
and caprices of the sick are to be yielded to as a matter of
course. I only object to an useless and injudicious warfare
with them. There should always be firmness exercised in
the management of the sick, but there should be no struggle
with them from mere pride of opinion, or a desire for
authority, or from want of a proper charity for their mental
weakness. They should never be directly opposed,
except it be distinctly and manifestly for their good.</p>

<p>One very common mistake in the mental management of
some chronic cases remains to be noticed. I refer to those
cases in which the nervous system is so deranged, as to
produce a variety of sensations of a deceptive character.
Such patients are generally laughed at as hypochondriacs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
and they are told by their friends, and sometimes even by
physicians, that these sensations are wholly imaginary.
This is not so. Some of their notions about them are mere
imaginations, it is true; but the sensations themselves are,
to some extent at least, real. Imagination may magnify
them, but it does not ordinarily create them. The wrong
ground which is so often taken in regard to such patients,
sometimes essentially retards their recovery. They feel
that they are trifled with, and they have but little confidence
in the judgment of those who deny that their sensations are
real, and therefore have but little if any in the remedies
which they administer to them. Besides, the mind of the
patient is disturbed continually by the disputes and consequent
ill feeling which such differences of opinion necessarily
engender, and this of course has a tendency to aggravate
the diseased condition.</p>

<p>As an illustration of these remarks, I will mention a single
case. The patient, who had long been an invalid, had,
among a great variety of sensations, a burning, twinging,
sometimes a pulling sensation, in the region of the stomach.
Her notion about it was that there was a cancer there, that
really pulled, and burned, and twinged. She had been assured
again and again that there was no cancer there, but
so little credit had been given to her account of her sensations
by those who had told her so, that she had on her part
given little credit to their knowledge of her case. I immediately
told her that I had no doubt that the nerves in that
part of the body were the seat of the sensations she described,
but that she was wrong in the disease which she fancied to
be the cause of those sensations. By taking this plain and
obviously proper ground with her as to the nature of her
case, making the true distinction between what was real
and what was imagined, she was induced to give up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
imaginary notion that was weighing down her spirits. This
view of her case, so consonant with the faithful report of
her own sensations from day to day, commended itself to
her common sense, and by inspiring confidence and hope,
did quite as much for her recovery as any other remedial
means that were used.</p>

<p>Among the great variety of topics which have suggested
themselves in connection with the subject of this chapter
I have selected those, the discussion and illustration of which
would most interest and profit the general reader. There
are two topics, however, of this character which require so
extended a notice, that I shall devote to each of them a
separate chapter. I refer to insanity, and the influence of
hope in the treatment of disease.</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter I remark, that the subject of
it demands of medical men a more distinct and thorough
attention than it commonly receives. The physician should
be something more than a <em>mere doser of the body</em>. Mental
influences are among the most important of our appliances
in the cure of disease. The physician, therefore, in
fulfilling his high vocation, should not only have a full
knowledge of mental philosophy, but he should aim to
acquire a practical skill in applying its principles to all the
ever varying phases, which the mind presents in its connection
with disease. The possession of this skill is one of
the most valuable endowments of the medical art.</p>

<span class="fs80">INSANITY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It is not the object of this chapter to treat at large of
insanity. It is my intention to speak, as briefly as possible,
of some points in regard to its causes and its treatment,
which ought to be understood by the community.</p>

<p>The causes of insanity may be divided into two classes—those
which act upon the mind, and those which act upon
the body.</p>

<p>The mental causes of insanity do not produce the disease
directly through their influence upon the mind. But this
influence extends to the organization with which the mind
is connected; and the insane manifestations or symptoms
are entirely the result of the reaction of the affected organization
upon the mind. As this point has been somewhat
fully elucidated in the chapter on <em>the Mutual Influence of
Mind and Body in Disease</em>, it is not necessary to dwell upon
it here.</p>

<p>The physical causes of insanity may be subdivided into
three classes; those which act upon the great central organ
of the mind, the brain; those which produce disease in
other organs, affecting the brain sympathetically; and those
which have a more general influence upon the system as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
whole, or as a congeries of organs. In an individual predisposed
to insanity by the peculiar cast of his nervous system,
this malady may be induced by some local disease of
some of the organs, or by an impaired state of the general
health.</p>

<p>There is commonly too much disposition to look to some
one thing, as the cause of the insanity in each individual
case. And this disposition is encouraged by the tables of
causes, which appear in some of the reports which are
issued from our Insane Hospitals. These tables cannot be
made up with any degree of correctness. They are therefore
of little, if any, use; and they are even calculated to
lead to error, if any great reliance be placed upon them.
In the great majority of cases of insanity, the disease is the
result of a concurrence of causes, and not of one cause
alone. Perhaps it will be said, that in constructing these
tables the <em>predominant</em> cause is sought for in each case. If
it be, it is by no means always easy to find it. In very
many cases there must be much doubt in regard to it; and
in no small proportion of them candor would lead to the
confession, that we are entirely in the dark on this question.
In the classification of causes, the class of <em>doubtful</em> or
<em>unknown</em> should be much more numerous than it usually
is in the annual reports of Institutions for the Insane.</p>

<p>One of the mistakes which are committed by the community,
and sometimes even by physicians, in regard to the
causes of insanity, deserves a passing notice. The <em>form</em>
of the derangement is often considered as indicative of the
nature of its cause. It is by no means necessarily so. For
example, an individual, who in his derangement talks mostly
on the subject of religion, cannot as a matter of course be
considered as having become insane through religious excitement.
It may have been so, but the bare fact, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
religion furnishes the subjects of his insane ideas and feelings,
is no absolute proof that it is so. As well might it be
said, that a patient who thinks that he has no stomach, of
course became insane through abuse of that organ. A
very common cause of insanity of a religious character is
an impaired state of the general health; and the insane
ideas run in that particular channel very often from the
influence of merely collateral, or adventitious circumstances.</p>

<p>Neither can the form of the derangement furnish any
conclusive evidence as to the character of the patient. Persons
of the purest minds, and of the deepest reverence for
the Deity, are sometimes in their insanity exceedingly profane
and obscene.</p>

<p>It is important that the public should be informed in relation
to the <em>causes</em> of insanity, in order that these causes may
as far as possible, be avoided. I will therefore notice some
of them very briefly.</p>

<p>One of the causes of insanity is an indulgence of the
passions. I take as an example the passion of pride. When
this passion has obtained a monstrous growth from long
indulgence, a severe mortification of it, especially if it be
repeated or continued, will produce insanity in those who
are predisposed to this disease, and sometimes in those who
have no marked predisposition of this character. Many
cases of this kind may be found in our Retreats.</p>

<p>In this connection I mention, as another source of insanity,
the wrong views of life, the false principles, and the
sickly sentimentalism, which are infused insensibly into the
mind by a very large proportion of the fictitious literature
of the world. This influence is a more prolific source of
insanity than is commonly supposed. Not only is it exerted
upon the reader as an individual, but it affects through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
multitude of readers the general tone of thought and feeling,
and thus acts widely, not merely as a particular, but as a
general cause of insanity.</p>

<p>Anything which causes an undue excitement in the mind
has a tendency to produce insanity. A too exclusive and
prolonged attention to one subject has this effect. It is in
this way in part that ultraism acts as a cause of this disease.
The brain becomes wearied out and weakened by
one kind of effort, just as the muscles of the school boy’s
arm are tired out, when, as a punishment, he is compelled
to hold with outstretched arm any heavy article for some
considerable length of time. A wearied and weakened
brain, when the infliction which produces this result, is
frequent and long continued, is apt to become diseased;
and one of the diseases to which it is thus made liable is
insanity.</p>

<p>It is said that insanity is hardly known among the savage
and uncivilized. There are two reasons for this. They
are the intellectual torpor, and the physical vigor, which
result from the habits of the savage. Wild passion, it is
true, sometimes lashes his mind into fury, but it easily subsides
into its usual repose, and the firm fibres of the brain
and nerves suffer no injury from the shock. So also in
countries which are ruled by despotic governments, the
mental torpor which prevails makes insanity a rare disease.</p>

<p>As the intellectual torpor and the physical vigor of savage
life prevent the occurrence of insanity; so on the other
hand, the intellectual activity and the physical debility of
civilized life conduce to its existence. Mental excitement
combined with luxury and effeminacy is a prolific source of
this disease. In this age, and especially in this nation, the
mental activities in every department of effort are so lively,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
and have so little intervals of relaxation, that the wear and
tear of brain in all this conflict produce an unusual amount
of insanity, greater as is shown by statistics, than in any
other country in the world.</p>

<p>It is not strange that the excitement which is created in
the mind by the stirring motives presented by religion,
should sometimes occasion mental derangement. The
struggle which it often awakens against the passions, and
propensities, and errors, which have accumulated in amount
and force by long indulgence in sin, must render persons of
considerable nervous susceptibility liable to this disease.
But in such cases religion acts only as the exciting cause,
while the predisposing causes have been exerting their
influence through a long series of years. And it is to be
remembered, that though, even when it is properly taught
and enforced, it may occasionally act as the exciting cause
of insanity, its general influence tends to remove the predisposing
causes to which I have alluded, and its universal
prevalence would be attended by their entire removal. It
is also to be remembered, that of all those cases which are
charged to religion by an indiscriminating public, and by
the enemies of Christianity, in very few of them is the
insanity produced by the proper presentation of religious
truth, while in the great majority of them it owes its origin
to the wild vagaries and the rash measures of the errorist,
the ultraist, and the fanatic.</p>

<p>A fruitful source of insanity is to be found in a general
debilitated condition of the system, which may be induced
by a great variety of causes. Such a condition is commonly
characterized by a morbid nervous irritability, which,
with the aid of concurring causes, often produces mental
derangement. A very large proportion of the inmates of
our Insane Retreats present this condition of system. Their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
physical and mental energies have both been exhausted by
incessant toil, and care, and anxiety from year to year, and
long continued ill-health has at length resulted in insanity.
I may remark that we see, in the loss of physical vigor as a
cause of insanity, the chief reason why there are more
females than males among the insane.</p>

<p>As intemperance combines so many of the agencies
which tend to produce insanity, it is justly considered as
one of the most prolific sources of this disease. Strong
drink exerts its destructive influence upon the whole man,
mental, moral, and physical. It dethrones the reason, and
inflaming the passions, gives them the supremacy. It
creates a morbid excitement throughout the whole nervous
system, and especially in the brain, the great central organ
of this system, and the instrument of the mind. It affects
other organs also, and particularly the stomach, which sympathizes
so readily with the brain, that its disorders, as is
known to every one, have a great influence upon that organ.
Strong drink, therefore, acting in these different ways upon
the system, not only expends the vital power rapidly, bringing
on premature old age, but it makes its deposites of disease
here and there in the various organs, which seriously
embarrass them in the performance of their functions.
With such an impaired and diseased state of the system,
and with the constant excitement to which both body and
mind are subjected, it is no wonder that the intemperate are
peculiarly liable to insanity.</p>

<p>In looking at the causes of insanity we readily discover
the reason why children are so seldom insane, though, from
the liveliness of their sympathies, they are much more apt
to be <em>temporarily</em> deranged by disease than adults are, as
we see in the paroxysms of fever. The brain and nervous
system require a long series of influences to bring them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
into such a state, as renders them liable to that class of
diseases, which we include under the name of insanity.
This state is an accumulated result of the action of predisposing
causes, continued for some length of time, perhaps
during all the previous life of the patient. But the derangement
of the child ceases with the temporary disease which
causes it. Its organs, not being incumbered with any accumulations
of disease, return readily to the performance of
their healthy functions; and its nervous system not having
been shattered with repeated attacks of sickness, and not
having experienced the wear and tear of trouble and toil,
resumes at once its usual free and easy and buoyant condition.</p>

<p>But, though insanity is not a common disease in the early
years of life, the foundations are often laid for it in this
forming period. The intellectual is often cultivated at the
expense of the physical, thus inducing that debilitated, and
at the same time irritable state of system, which you have
seen is one of the prominent causes of insanity. The passions,
instead of being curbed by reasonable restraints, are
left to run riot. False views of life are permitted, with all
the bewitching fascinations which genius and fancy and wit
can furnish, to stamp their impress upon the mind, and
through it upon the brain during the impressible period of
its growth. Luxury too pampers the appetites, and gives
to them a supremacy, which debases and impairs alike the
physical and the mental powers. When the child therefore
becomes the man, it is not strange that the predisposition,
thus formed within him by this moral and physical training,
should become more and more developed amid the stirring
and troublous scenes of active life, till at length, through
the agency of some exciting cause, insanity appears as the
accumulated result of all these evil influences. Education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
then, using the word in its widest sense, has much to do
with the production of insanity when it is directed by wrong
principles; and, on the other hand, it can be made under
proper management, to exert a powerful influence in the
prevention of this disease.</p>

<p>Let me now call the attention of the reader to a few
considerations in regard to the forms and the signs of
insanity.</p>

<p>In some cases the symptoms of this disease are from the
first of so marked a character that no one can mistake the
nature of the malady. But in other cases its signs are for
a long time indistinct, and no period can be accurately fixed
upon as marking the commencement of the disease. Such
cases are apt to be very obstinate, and the longer they continue
without proper treatment, the more difficult is it to
effect a cure. And delay is so common on the part of
friends in relation to such cases, that many of them, in
which an early adoption of the proper course would have
resulted in an entire restoration to health, become incurable
before anything effectual is done. In order that cases of
this character should not be thus neglected, the community
need to be enlightened in regard to them.</p>

<p>The conversation and the conduct of such patients often
exhibit no signs of aberration of mind, which would strike
the common observer, even when the disease has existed for
some length of time. And when physicians assert that they
are insane, some of their friends are apt to doubt in regard
to it, and sometimes they even controvert the assertion.
Of many cases of this character which have come under
my observation, I will allude to but two. One of them is
the case of a lady, whose insanity, which had taken the
form of religious ultraism, had been coming on very gradually
for a long time. Though it was of so deep a character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
as to be absolutely incurable, many even very sensible
persons among her acquaintances expressed their doubt
of the necessity of taking her to an Insane Hospital, and
probably would have cast blame upon me for so doing, had
she not at one time summoned her friends around her, and
after giving some singular directions and parting counsels,
retired to her chamber and laid herself down to die. Such
palpable acts as this, are often the first evidence that convinces
the friends of a patient of the reality of his insanity.
Though it may have existed for weeks or months, they
perhaps have thought him to be nervous and ‘in a strange
way,’ as it is expressed, but they have not really supposed
him to be insane.</p>

<p>The other case which I will mention is one which was
brought to the consideration of the civil authority of the
town. I was called upon to testify in relation to it. The
proofs of this gentleman’s insanity, which I adduced, were
even made the subject of ridicule by a portion of that wise
body of men, and yet his insanity very soon became so
decided that he might be seen from day to day in our streets
picking up rags and strings and bits of wood and coal.</p>

<p>The delusions of some patients are confined to some particular
subjects. Upon these their insanity will appear in
their conversation, while upon all other subjects they are
perfectly rational. A man, who conversed with the utmost
propriety on all other topics, on being asked if he believed
in Jesus Christ, said at once, ‘I am Jesus Christ.’ A lady,
who had very ambitious desires in relation to her husband’s
standing in society, became insane upon this point alone, and
while she was as rational as ever on all other subjects, she
constantly poured a storm of reproach and abuse upon him,
because he was not as great a man as she wished and expected
he would be. A lady, who had been much fatigued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
in preparing for house-keeping, upon going into her new
abode contracted a feeling in regard to the house, which
was something more than a mere dislike—it was a horror.
She could not bear to be in it, especially if she were alone.
She had an impression, ill-defined but unconquerable and
ever present, that something dreadful would happen to her
if she remained there. She said that she had rather live
anywhere else, even in the poorest shanty. Her friends
thought that it was a foolish notion, which she could overcome
if she would make the effort. But they were mistaken.
She was really insane on that one point. I recommended
that she should be permitted to stay away from her house
so long as she desired it, and that her mind should be diverted
by journeying and visiting. A few weeks sufficed to
remove the delusion. I once knew a similar case in which
the patient was not removed, and her misery finally drove
her to the commission of suicide.</p>

<p>It may be remarked of these cases of monomania, as it
is termed, that they do not ordinarily retain the same definite
and exclusive character which they at first have. If
the insanity continue for some length of time, other delusions
are apt to be added to the original one.</p>

<p><em>Moral</em> insanity is a form of the disease which is scarcely
believed to exist by the community at large, and our courts
of justice are very reluctant to recognise it, and will not do
so without the most indisputable and abundant evidence.
And yet this form of insanity is by no means rare. Many
cases of it are found in our Retreats; and the outrages,
which such patients commit, are occasionally made the
subject of investigation before our legal tribunals. It is an
insanity of the moral sense, affecting the intellect little if at
all. Dr. Bell in speaking of it says, “There is insanity of
<em>conduct</em>, but not of <em>conversation</em>; the persons afflicted are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
capable of reasoning with correctness and energy upon premises
not only false, but which they know to be false, and
frequently display the greatest ingenuity in giving reasons
for and explaining away their eccentric and unjustifiable
conduct, and accounting for the change which, they will
admit, has occurred in the whole tone and temper of their
dispositions and propensities.</p>

<p>“It is a form of disease in which, perhaps more than in
any other, acts which, in a rational and responsible being
would be crimes, are committed. It occurs, at times, as the
sequel of violent attacks of mania,—it passes into decided
mania or demency,—it alternates with intellectual derangements;
all which circumstances afford an adequate presumption
of its being a genuine form of insanity.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>“Sometimes” says Professor Smith of New York, in a
very excellent description of this form of insanity, “it shows
itself in the abandonment of ordinary habits and pursuits;
in carelessness of one’s own affairs with random indulgence
in follies and gross sensualities. Sometimes it is seen in the
form of ardent devotion to a succession of projects, each suddenly
conceived and embraced, with, it is believed the certain
prospect of rapidly amassing wealth, or advancing in honor
and happiness—and each as suddenly given up in disgust.
In some cases there is an uncontrollable disposition to merriment,
boisterous hilarity, and sportive and mischievous
conduct towards others. Occasionally the more striking
phenomena are inflated pride, exquisite vanity, and contempt
of ordinary things. Frequently it assumes the character
of melancholy or deep gloom, attended with fondness
for solitude, and forebodings of evil when all around and in
prospect is inviting and joyous. A form not uncommon
displays itself in an unaccountable partiality for particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
persons, and a dislike of the nearest and dearest friends, with
a disposition to revile and injure them. The more serious
varieties are those in which there is a suicidal propensity, or
a feeling of necessity to commit some dreadful crime—for
example, to destroy a certain individual, perhaps a relative,
as a tender and beloved child—an act, the execution of
which, the reasoning power strongly opposes, and the conscience
prevents by awakening the feeling of horror. These
restraining forces, however, are not always sufficient to curb
the strong propensity. Sometimes, as if urged irresistibly
by some demoniac influence, the fatal deed is perpetrated;
and instant relief from the burning passion is obtained; the
homicide feels that a part of his destiny is fulfilled, and hence
an emotion of satisfaction spreads over his mind. But such
relief is not always durable; regret and remorse may succeed,
and rankle long and deep in the soul.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>I will pass on now to a few remarks upon the <em>treatment</em>
of insanity.</p>

<p>The past history of the treatment of this disease is to a
great extent a history of tyranny and cruelty. The errors
and abuses which have generally marked the management
of the insane, till within a few years, are numerous and
truly horrible. But these errors and abuses are fast passing
away. Ever since the wise and humane physician, Pinel,
entered in 1792 the Bedlam of France, in whose cells three
hundred maniacs were chained, and in the short space of a
few days knocked off the chains from fifty-three of them
with none but happy results, the management of the insane
has been becoming steadily more wise and merciful from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
year to year.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In producing this change throughout the
community, the public institutions for the insane have had
a great agency. I will therefore pass at once to the consideration
of the usefulness of these institutions, as the best
mode which I can adopt for developing the principles to be
observed in the treatment of insanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span></p>

<p>The advantages of Retreats, or Hospitals for the Insane,
may be summed up under three heads, which I will notice
separately.</p>

<p>1. In sending a patient to a Retreat you take him away
from all those mental associations under which his insanity
originated. These associations are so many <em>points of attachment</em>,
by which his malady is fastened upon him; and
it is therefore almost a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i> in the cure to release
him from their influence. The power of these associations
is most strikingly shown in the renewal of the insanity, in
those who are returned to their homes before their restoration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
is fairly confirmed. Change of scene, as is known to
every one, has a good effect upon invalids generally; but it
is especially true of those invalids whose disease is insanity.
Accordingly a very important part of the treatment of the
insane in a Retreat, consists in such a management of their
occupations and amusements, as will best divert their
minds from those channels of thought and feeling, in which
they have previously run.</p>

<p>2. The insane are ordinarily subjected to a more judicious
<em>medical</em> treatment in a Hospital than they are among their
friends. It is the testimony of all who have had charge of
the insane, that their restoration depends mostly upon regimen,
or the regulation of their occupations and amusements,
bodily and mental, and very little indeed upon medicine.
It is undoubtedly true, that the deranged are very often
injured by too much positive medication prior to their admission
to a Retreat. They are first dosed by their friends,
and the physician who is called in, having had perhaps but
a limited experience in insanity, places too high an estimate
on the curative power of remedies in this malady, and gives
the patient altogether too much medicine. It was once very
common to bleed the insane. But it is now settled by the
accumulated experience of the profession, that very few of
them require this measure, and that most of them would
certainly be injured by a reducing practice.</p>

<p>3. In sending a patient to a Retreat, you place him under
a better moral and mental management than he can have
among his friends. There is a peculiar tact requisite for
the proper management of the insane, which some seem to
possess naturally, and which is much improved by actual
practice. In the selection of attendants in our Retreats
special regard is of course had to the possession of this
qualification. The attendants are therefore skilful in managing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
the insane mind. They are free from those errors
which are so common in the community in relation to the
treatment of insanity, and which often do so much harm to
the insane while they continue under the care of their
friends at their homes. Some of these errors it will be
profitable to notice briefly in this connection.</p>

<p>It is very common for the friends of the insane to attempt
to <em>reason</em> them out of their delusions. If the derangement
be of a religious type, the clergyman, or some excellent
friend, endeavors by argument to convince the patient of
his error. This is in vain, and worse than in vain. <em>It
uniformly does harm.</em> It does nothing but strengthen the
patient’s confidence in his notions, and make him more
earnest and obstinate in their defence.</p>

<p>It is quite common still, though not so much so as it
once was, to practice deception upon the insane. This
ruinous error I comment upon in the chapter on <em>Veracity
in our Intercourse with the Sick</em>, to which I refer the
reader.</p>

<p>Another error which is frequently committed, is to pursue
a timid course at one time and a violent one at another,
instead of one which is both mild and firm throughout.
This error has been the cause of the practice of much unnecessary
cruelty in the domestic treatment of the insane.</p>

<p>These and other errors are for the most part avoided by
the attendants in our Hospitals. They have no needless
collisions with the patients in regard to their notions and
delusions. They practice no deception upon them, but win
their confidence by an open and candid intercourse. Their
conduct towards them is marked with mildness, and they
make use of no more restraint than is absolutely necessary,
and that with calm firmness, instead of impetuous and noisy
violence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span></p>

<p>It is a common observation that the deranged are apt to
look upon their most intimate friends as their enemies;
while, on the other hand, they are ordinarily much attached
to their attendants and physicians. The reasons of this I
will briefly notice. In every family, however warm may
be its attachments, and however strong may be the control
of principle in its members, there must be differences of
taste and feeling and opinion, and a mutual yielding on
these points is absolutely essential to the maintenance of
harmony and peace. Now if one of the members of that
family become deranged, his self-restraint is gone, and he
no longer does his part of the yielding. He becomes unreasonable,
obstinate, opinionative. There is no more
agreeing to differ on his part. All the points of difference
between him and his friends become now to him so many
battle grounds; and those whom he fights he is apt to hate.
The injudicious discussions and disputes, which friends are
disposed to hold with the insane, add to the difficulty. Then
too the deceptions, which most persons feel themselves
authorized to practice in such cases are certain to confirm
the enmity, by destroying the confidence of the insane in
their candor and honesty. I need not stop to show, that
there is an absence of all these circumstances in the intercourse
between the insane and their attendants in a Retreat.</p>

<p>The reader cannot have failed to see in the course of my
remarks, that it is very important that the insane should
early come under proper treatment. The first indications of
insanity should be noticed, and measures should at once be
taken to convey the patient to some Retreat. The delay
which is so apt to occur in relation to those, in whom the
malady comes on slowly and imperceptibly, is one great
reason why so many of them are incurable. If these could
all in the very beginning be removed away from the influences,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
which have produced and are maturing their insanity
and be placed under proper treatment, many more of them
would undoubtedly recover than now do.</p>

<p>Among the most helpless and pitiable of the miserable in
this world are the insane poor. Ordinary sickness requires
only ordinary care. But insanity is a malady, which not
only often requires more care than other sickness, but a
care which is, as you have seen, of a peculiar character—such
as the comfortless home, the want, and the ignorance
of the poor are unfit to supply. It is the duty of society
therefore to make systematic and ample provision for the
proper care of this class of the insane. In many of the
states some provision has been made for them, but it is very
inadequate. The provision in Connecticut is an annual
appropriation placed in the hands of the Governor to be
dispensed by him to applicants till the whole sum is expended.
In this way a large number of the insane poor
have secured to them a residence for a suitable period in
the Retreat at Hartford. This is well so far as it goes, but
it is not sufficient. <em>All</em> the insane poor in the State should
be provided for. And the expense need not be very great
if a proper plan be adopted. A portion of the expense, one
third or one half, should be defrayed in each case by the
town where the patient resides. In this way any improper
use of the public benefaction would be guarded against, for
the local authorities would, in behalf of the towns, secure
a suitable examination of the pecuniary circumstances of
the patients. Such a plan would be a truly economical
one. For many, who, with the scanty and irregular provision
which is now made, are left to become hopelessly
insane, and to be therefore lasting burdens to the towns in
which they reside, would under a better plan be restored
and become able to support themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span></p>

<p>This chapter is already so long, that I must devote less
space than I originally intended to the <em>legal relations</em> of insanity.
A few points only can be briefly noticed.</p>

<p>The legal relations of insanity are very imperfectly
understood, even by those who are concerned in the administration
of justice. The lawyer at the bar, and the judge
on the bench, often exhibit great ignorance on this subject.
The history of the legal definitions of insanity, given by
learned judges, is almost from beginning to end a history of
profound blunders. And yet these definitions have been
the guide in trials in which insanity has been alleged, except
when they have been set aside by the plain common
sense of the jury, as has sometimes very fortunately been
the case. In speaking of the inconsistencies and absurdities
of the English law in relation to insanity, Dr. Bell, in
his valuable report to which I have before had occasion to
refer, remarks, that “from the test of Judge Tracey, that
to exempt from criminal responsibility, the patient should
know absolutely nothing, to that of a later tribunal, where
ability to repeat the multiplication table was gravely considered
as the exact point in a civil case, the doctrines and
decisions have been amusingly strange and inconsistent.
Even cunning, foresight, calculation, all possessed occasionally
in a wonderful degree by the most insane patients
of every hospital, have been regularly decided by the highest
English tribunals, to contraindicate the existence of that
degree of alienation which implies criminal irresponsibility!”</p>

<p>The course which is adopted by our courts, to decide
whether a man accused of any crime is insane and therefore
irresponsible, is a very objectionable one. In France
they are far in advance of us on this subject. The course
there is to place the accused, if suspected of insanity, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
the examination of a commission composed of men who
are practically qualified to decide such a question. “Upon
them,” says Dr. Bell, “rests the awful responsibility of determining
the state of the mind of the accused, as to the
one fact of insanity; they approach him at all times, they
watch his actions in his presence and without his knowledge;
his habits, his sleeping and waking hours, his physical
condition, everything in fact which can throw light
upon the momentous question, passes under slow, persevering,
scientific investigation. Under the responsibility of
reputations as precious to them as those of the highest
court, and under the sanction of an oath, they arrive at
conclusions, and present their reasons for such conclusions,
which form one, not the exclusive, element for a court and
jury to arrive at a just judgment.</p>

<p>How are the facts, elucidating the state of a prisoner’s
mind after a doubtful act, ascertained with us? The functions
devolved in France upon the bright professional luminaries
such as I have named, here fall upon the gaoler, the
constables, and the turnkeys. <em>Experts</em> may on the day of
final trial be summoned in, to give their opinions on testimony,
derived from such sources as this! No provision
exists for any investigation beyond the <em>volunteer</em> aid, which
such an ungracious task will rarely secure. The moment
for investigating the perhaps fleeting manifestations and
evidences of disease passes, before the law makes the least
advances for the prisoner’s protection. I have even known
the instance of a professional man whose life was spent
among the insane, and who, moved solely by humane feeling,
had visited in prison a friendless wretch whose homicidal
act was feared from circumstances to be the result of
insanity, being held up and vilified to a jury by a government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
functionary, for his <em>officious</em> intermeddling in matters
in which he had no concern!”</p>

<p>Such having been the opinions and practices of our
courts of justice, it is not strange that the rights of the
insane have often been trampled upon and that <em>even life
has been sometimes sacrificed under all the solemn formalities
of law, for acts committed in the irresponsible condition
of insanity</em>. I could cite <em>many</em> sad cases in illustration,
but I will merely advert to one of a recent date, which
the efforts of one individual prevented from being added to
the long list of cases, in which the robe of justice has been
stained by the blood of irresponsible maniacs. I refer to
the trial of the poor negro Freeman, who killed the Van
Nest family, consisting of four persons. In this case a
verdict of guilty was given, and the community who came
near resorting to Lynch law before the trial, were eager to
have the sentence executed. Governor Seward, who, to
his praise be it spoken, as a volunteer nobly stemmed the
raging torrent of popular excitement, defended the prisoner.
He succeeded in obtaining a grant for a new trial. This trial
never took place. The judge, before whom he was to be
tried, visited the prisoner in his cell, and becoming satisfied
of his insanity, refused to try him. In a few short months
the prisoner died, leaving no doubt upon the mind of any
one acquainted with the case that he was truly insane.</p>

<p>It is true that the plea of insanity, just like any other
plea, is often set up when there is very little ground for it.
But there is good reason to believe, that it is very seldom
established and made the basis of an acquittal, when it
ought not to be. Dr. Bell remarked upon this point in
1844, that “it may be a consolation and an encouragement
to juries, in faithfully following out their own sincere convictions
upon the law and evidence in such cases, to know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
that in a pretty diligent inquiry as to the event of every
case of homicide in New England, where the accused has
had the defence of insanity ‘set up’ for him, and been
acquitted on that ground, it has been found that <em>not a single
instance has occurred, where the progress of time has
not abundantly verified the soundness of the defence</em>.” And
he has recently informed me that this assertion holds true
up to the present time.</p>

<p>While it is important that justice should be secured to
the insane, when placed under trial for acts which they have
committed, it is of still greater importance that such acts
should, if possible, be prevented. If, when a man in an
irresponsible condition destroys the life of a fellow-man, we
prevent his innocent blood from being shed, we do well:
but if we recognise the existence of that condition, and the
danger to others which attends it, sufficiently early, to take
measures to prevent his destroying the life of his fellow-man,
<em>we do better</em>.</p>

<p>This point of prevention should be made an especial
object of legislation. But in this country the laws which
aim at this object are exceedingly defective. In Connecticut
it is the duty of the civil authority and select men to
order “any lunatic, who is dangerous and unfit to be without
restraint to be confined in some suitable place.” If
they fail to attend to the complaint, in three days it may be
brought before any justice of the peace, and he can issue
such an order. In Massachusetts the judges of Probate
may commit to the hospital any lunatic “who in their
opinion is so furiously mad, as to render it manifestly dangerous
to the peace and safety of the community, that he
should be at large.” The objectionable points in these provisions
are two. 1. Those are made the judges of the fact
of insanity, and of the danger to the peace and safety of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
the community attendant upon it, who are not competent
to pass such judgment. When we say that judges of probate,
selectmen, and justices of the peace are not thus competent,
we say nothing to their discredit. Insanity is a
subject which they have no opportunity of understanding
with any definiteness or to any extent. 2. The terms in
which these provisions are couched show, that only great
and manifest danger is contemplated by them. Some outrage
or attempt at outrage is commonly therefore to be
proved, in order to authorize in the view of the law the
confinement of the person complained of.</p>

<p>With such defects in the provisions of the law, it is no
wonder that the community is occasionally shocked with
outrageous, even fatal acts by insane persons, who through
neglect have been permitted to go at large. Indeed, in some
cases there has been no apprehension of danger up to the
time of the commission of such acts; and yet if these cases
had been submitted to the examination of those who have
knowledge and skill on the subject of insanity, the danger
would, generally, at least, have been foreseen, and the acts
would therefore have been prevented. To secure such an
examination a standing commission of lunacy should be
appointed, composed of physicians who are properly qualified
to decide the important questions which would come
before them. Every case of suspected insanity should be
subjected to their examination, and it should be their duty
to prescribe what measures shall be adopted in regard to
each case. Such a commission would not only prevent the
peace and safety of the community in many cases from
being violated, and save many valuable lives, but it would
also secure a recovery in many cases of insanity in which
now neglect renders such a result impossible.</p>

<p>Many other points in regard to the legal relations of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
insanity might be noticed with profit and interest to the
general reader, but this chapter is already sufficiently long.
In conclusion I cannot but express the hope that our lawyers
and judges will give more attention to this part of
medical jurisprudence; and that the abuses which exist
may be speedily removed, so that the pretender to insanity
may be sure to be detected and punished, and the truly
insane may as surely be secured in their rights.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42" class="label">[42]</a> The following very interesting account of this experiment is taken
from an article on the treatment of lunatics, in the London Quarterly.</p>

<p>It was during the reign of terror, and while all France labored under a
new form of insanity, that the idea was first conceived of setting loose
madmen from their bonds. The good and wise physician, Pinel, seems to
have been struck with the injustice of keeping the patients chained in the
dungeons of Bicetre, while so many hundreds of his countrymen, more
mischievously distracted than many of them, were at large to work the
bloody frolics of the revolutionary frenzy. There were at that time upwards
of 300 maniacs chained in the loathsome cells of the horrible Bedlam of
France. Pinel formed the resolution of setting them free from their strict
restraint, and he entreated permission of the Commune to that effect. Struck
with the novelty of the enterprise, at that time a sufficient recommendation
before any assembly in France, the Commune listened to the proposal, and
deputed one of their body, the notorious Couthon, to accompany the physician
to the spot, and judge of the propriety of carrying his undertaking
into effect. They were received by a confused noise—the yells and vociferations
of some hundreds of madmen, mixed with the sounds of their
clanking chains, echoing through the damp and dreary vaults of the prison.
Couthon turned away with horror, but he permitted Pinel to pursue his
enterprise. The philanthropist resolved speedily to liberate fifty of the
number by way of experiment, and began by unchaining twelve of the most
violent. The account of his proceeding has been recorded by his nephew,
Sclyion Pinel, in a lively narrative, which was read before the Academy of
Sciences. The first man set at liberty was an English captain. He had
been forty years in chains, and his history was forgotten by himself and all
the world. His keepers approached him with dread; he had killed one of
their comrades by a blow with his manacles. Pinel entered his cell unattended,
and accosted him in a kind and confiding manner, and told him
that it was designed to give him the liberty of walking abroad, on condition
that he would put on a waistcoat that might confine his arms. The madman
appeared to disbelieve; but he obeyed. His chains were removed,
and the door of the cell was left open. Many times he raised himself and
fell back; his limbs gave way; they had been ironed forty years. At length
he was able to stand and to stalk to the door of his dark cell, and to gaze,
with exclamations of wonder and delight, at the beautiful sky. He spent
the day in the enjoyment of his newly-acquired privilege; he was no
more in bonds; and during the two years of his farther detention at Bicetre,
assisted in managing the house. The next man liberated was a soldier,
a private in the French guards, who had been ten years in chains, and was
an object of general fear. His case had been one of acute mania, occasioned
by intemperance—a disorder which often subsides in a short time
under abstinence from intoxicating drinks unless kept up, as in this case,
by improper treatment. When set at liberty, this man willingly assisted
Pinel in breaking the chains of his fellow prisoners; he became immediately
calm, and even kind and attentive, and was ever afterwards the devoted
friend of his deliverer. In an adjoining cell there were three
Prussian soldiers, who had been many years in chains and darkness; through
grief and despair they had sunk into a state of stupor and fatuity, the frequent
result of similar treatment; they refused to be removed. Near to
them was an old priest, harmless and patient, who fancied himself to be
the Savior of the world. When taunted by the keepers, who used to tell
him that, if he was Christ, he could break the heavy chains that loaded
his hands, he replied with solemn dignity, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Frustra tentaris Dominum
tuum</i>. After his release he got rid of his illusion, and recovered the
soundness of his mind. Within a few days Pinel liberated fifty-three
maniacs from their imprisonment. The result was beyond his hopes.
Tranquility and harmony succeeded to tumult and disorder, and even the
most ferocious madmen became more tractable. This took place in 1792;
and the example of Pinel was followed in various parts of France.</p>

<span class="fs80">INFLUENCE OF HOPE IN THE TREATMENT OF DISEASE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>I remember well that Dr. Jackson of Boston used to
remark to the students, that the medical profession is, from
the nature of its duties, a <em>cheerful</em> profession. The physician
has so much to do with suffering, disease, and death,
that this assertion would at first view seem to be erroneous.
But when it is considered that in the great majority of cases
he is able to effect a cure, that in those which terminate in
death he can generally give relief to suffering from time to
time, and thus at least smooth the passage to the tomb, and
that the number of sick whose diseases he can neither
palliate nor cure is exceedingly small, we can see why it is
that the physician is ordinarily so cheerful a man in his
daily intercourse. The impressions of most persons on this
subject are wrong, and for very obvious reasons. Out of
their own immediate circle of relations and friends, they
hear only of the severe cases of disease, and often only of
those in which death is the result, and know but little,
perhaps nothing, of the multitude of cases, here and there
in every part of the community, which end in recovery.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it is true, sad cases occur which cast a gloom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
over the path of the physician; but then the gloom is soon
dissipated by the successful issue of other cases which he
had reason to fear would have a fatal termination. Sometimes,
too, unfortunate cases come in clusters, and the physician
is for the time obliged to see so much of suffering
and death, and the sorrows of bereavement, that in his
sadness he is ready to regret that he ever adopted such a
profession. But this happens only occasionally. It is a
mere coincidence, and it is but momentary. Events soon
take their ordinary current, and he has his usual amount
of success, and resumes his wonted air of cheerfulness and
hope.</p>

<p>The results of the skilful and judicious practice of medicine
are such then as to make hope, and not despondency,
to characterize the prevailing cast of the physician’s mind.
And so it should be. For hope stimulates to action—steady,
clear-minded action—while despondency is prone
to inaction, and leads to no efforts except those which are
hurried, fitful and confused. I do not mean that the physician
should in any case blind himself to the dangers which
it presents, and let a vain hope lull him into security. This
error should be as carefully avoided as the opposite one,
committed by those who see difficulty and danger in almost
every case, magnifying every bad symptom, and imagining
some which have no existence. The hope of the physician
should be an intelligent hope. It should be based upon just
and definite conclusions. It should be discriminating, and
should be varied in its degree according to the character of
each individual case.</p>

<p>Every medicine that is given should be administered by
the hand of hope. The prospect, at least of relief, and
generally of recovery, should be held up to the mind of the
patient. Remedies should be given to effect some definite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
object, and the physician should hope to a greater or less
degree that they will do so. Hope may thus be indulged
in relation to the different stages of a case, without regard
to the final event of it, which may be so distant and so
clouded in doubt that no calculations can be made in regard
to it. And the physician may direct the attention of the
patient to these same points, and thus give variety to the
hope which he excites in his mind. This in many cases is
much better than to come to him every day with the simple
expression of the hope that he will at length recover. In
the tedium of his confinement, if it be a long one, he soon
tires of looking far ahead to the bright fields of convalescence,
but finds relief in the little spots lighted up of hope
by the way—the oases thus made in the desert of sickness.</p>

<p>Even in those cases in which the physician feels it to be
almost certain that the final issue will be a fatal one, it is
not proper to give up wholly the idea of recovery, in his
conversations with the patient or with his friends. This
remark must not be understood to apply to those cases in
which the evidence of approaching death is not to be mistaken,
and so far as human wisdom can see it is absolutely
certain that the patient will die. At the same time it is to
be remembered that there are occasionally recoveries when
death was confidently expected, and we must avoid being
too ready to decide that there is no ground of hope, especially
in cases of an acute disease.</p>

<p>I will relate a case in point. A physician was called in
great haste to a patient upon whom he had been attending
with deep anxiety. He found the family and the friends
assembled around the bed of the patient weeping over him
as a dying man. The physician himself thought from his
appearance that he was really dying. Still he did not <em>know</em>
that he was, and as he might possibly be in a condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
from which he could be revived, he prepared a cordial at
once, and with the look of hope and uttering the words of
hope, he administered it. The patient not only revived
but recovered. In his convalescence he told the physician
that as he lay there dimly seeing with his glazed eyes the
sad countenances of his friends, and feeling the oppressive
languor of death, as he supposed, upon him, and panting for
some cordial and for the pure air of heaven, and yet unable
to speak or even to raise the hand, no words could express
the relief which he at once felt, spreading a genial glow
over his benumbed body, when he heard his cheerful voice
speak of hope, and it seemed to him that this had more
influence in reviving him than the cordial which he administered.</p>

<p>Strong as this case is, similar cases are in the recollection
of every physician who has been in practice for any considerable
length of time. And they cannot be distinguished
from some other cases in which attempts to revive the sinking
powers fail, and the patient dies. Now it will not be
claimed that the physician does wrong in uttering the language
of hope in the case of those who recover; and he
certainly should not be reproached for uttering the same
language in the case of those who appear just as likely to
recover, but for some reason hidden from human wisdom
do not. Just as he would administer the cordial to all of
them, so also should he apply to all of them the cordial
influence of hope. The same rule is applicable to both the
mental and the physical remedy.</p>

<p>It is often said that if the physician, on the whole, taking
into view all the circumstances of the case, thinks that a
patient is going to die, he ought frankly to tell him so. The
considerations which I have presented are, I trust, sufficient
to convince the reader that this is by no means true. Shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
the physician, I ask, add to all the depressing agencies
which are bearing down the patient the appalling idea of
death, and thus lessen, perhaps destroy, the possibility of his
recovery? Shall he, in the struggle between life and death,
give his influence in any way on the side of death? When
the powers of life are sinking, and the life-giving fluid circulates
but feebly in the extremities of the system, and is
accumulating in the larger blood vessels and in the heart
itself, threatening every moment to stop its faint throbbings,
shall he, while he administers the cordial, defeat its effect,
by holding up to the eye of his patient the grim visage of
death, to oppress the vital forces and curdle the blood in its
channels? Shall he not rather pour into the mind the
cheering influence of hope, and thus aid the cordial in reviving
the expiring energies of the system, and in stimulating
the heart and the whole circulation into a freer action?</p>

<p>Let me be fully understood on this point. Far be it from
me to justify the wide departure from truth, of which some
are guilty at such times. Giving utterly false assurances to
the patient is a very different thing from merely exciting
the hope in his mind to such a degree as the case may
allow, that the remedies will produce the desired relief.
The latter can be consistently done by the upright and
high-minded practitioner, but the former is to be expected
only in the ignorant pretender, and the dishonorable and
unprincipled physician. The quack always gives assurances
of a cure to those whom he undertakes to dupe; for, besides
being incompetent to estimate the degree of danger in any
case, he is unable to inspire confidence in his measures
except by a strong appeal to the hopes of the patient. And
some physicians imitate the quack in this particular. They
are in the habit of exciting unwarrantably the hopes of the
sick for their own selfish ends. By so doing they occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
retain under their care patients who would otherwise
pass into the hands of some one else; and they also get
possession of some cases, in relation to which their more
honest and honorable brethren have not found themselves
warranted in giving any positive encouragement. But,
though occasional advantage may result from this course to
the physician, and sometimes even to the sick themselves,
yet on the whole the honest course is truly the politic one.</p>

<p>It is important, as I shall show more particularly in the
next chapter, that the physician maintain his character for
veracity and candor in his intercourse with his patients;
else, when he can consistently utter the language of hope,
it may prove no cordial, because his lips have so often
uttered that language so falsely. There are cases in which
death may seem to the patient and to his friends to be
staring him in the face, and yet the physician may see a
sure and speedy relief coming to all the alarming symptoms.
Now when he gives an assurance to this effect, in order to
quell the anxieties and fears of the sick man and his friends,
if he has been known to be in the habit of giving similar
assurances without any ground for them, he cannot expect
to be believed.</p>

<p>The views and feelings of patients, in regard to the
expectation of a recovery, are often misunderstood by their
friends. They are sometimes supposed to be wholly blind
to their danger, when they are really fully aware of it.
They perhaps speak occasionally of what they will do if
they get well, and allude to the expected effect of remedies,
as if they supposed that they would overcome the disease,
and dwell, in their conversation with their friends and with
the physician, upon the favorable symptoms that may
appear. All this may, and often does, occur in cases in
which death is almost certain to be the result; and yet it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
entirely consistent with the existence in the mind of the
patient of a rational view of his danger. I remember well
a respected friend, who talked of hope and relief now and
then almost to the last; and yet, from day to day, he was
making such preparations, even to the framing of his will,
as showed that, on the whole, he believed this to be his last
sickness.</p>

<p>We are not to confound these occasional expressions of
hope, these fitful and momentary states of mind, with the
settled conviction of the understanding often existing behind
all this. The promptings of the natural desire for life are
ordinarily not utterly destroyed by the sure prospect of
death. There will be moments when this instinctive love
of life, and of whatever in life has ministered to the happiness
of the sufferer, will turn off his thoughts from the contemplation
of death, and call up by association a thousand
objects of endearment.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">This pleasing, anxious being e’er resigned,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Nor cast one longing, ling’ring look behind?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is well that the hope of recovery should occasionally
light up in cases which are certain to end fatally, especially
when the patient is the subject of protracted chronic disease.
It breaks in upon that painful monotony of mind,
which is otherwise apt to exist. It is not commonly well
for any one, in any point of view, to have the certain expectation
of death fastened in the mind week after week and
month after month, even if he have all the while a clear
view with the eye of faith of a glorious immortality beyond.
This one unvaried state of thought and feeling, though
commonly spoken of as exceedingly to be desired, is ordinarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
neither so profitable nor so happy, as that condition
of mind, in which the expectation of death is not so constantly
present, but occasionally gives way to thoughts and
emotions of quite a different character. The keeping the
mind strained up to a certain state, and fixed upon one set
of thoughts, is never either in sickness or in health profitable
to the individual himself, or to others. And aside
from this consideration, though the calm and fixed contemplation
of approaching death has something noble in it, and
challenges our admiration, still the triumph over death may
be as signal, when there is occasionally an indulgence of
the natural desire of life, and a shrinking back from the
encounter with the king of terrors. The destruction of
this love of life, and the utter extinction of the hope of a
recovery, are by no means essential to perfect resignation.
Indeed the highest degree of resignation may exist when
the desire to live is so strong as to prompt the sufferer to
catch with eagerness at the slightest grounds of hope even
to the last. Incidental circumstances have much to do
with the manner in which death is met. A cool temperament,
the long continued cultivation of a stoical indifference
in the midst of change and calamity, a morbid misanthropy,
an habitual disposition to fatalism, the breaking up one after
another of all the attachments to this world, the benumbing
influence of disease or of medicine, long familiarity with
suffering, and the consequent capability of enduring it,
which is sometimes truly wonderful—some of these various
circumstances may conspire to render submission to the
necessity of the case easy, and give to the death-hour a
calmness that is often erroneously supposed to arise from a
true Christian resignation. The calmness thus induced is
often an incidental adjunct to resignation, and is sometimes
auxiliary to it, imparting to it firmness and steadiness in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
manifestations. But it is in no wise essential to it, nor one
of its elements.</p>

<p>In chronic cases, which are going on gradually to a fatal
termination, there sometimes occurs either a temporary
pause in the onward course of the disease, or an alleviation
of the symptoms of so decided a character, that the patient
and the physician cannot avoid indulging for the moment
the hope of a recovery. At such times the bosom of the
physician is the seat of conflicting hopes and fears. He
hardly dares to hope, when he calmly surveys the whole
case from the beginning. And yet he has known, he has
himself <em>seen</em> some strange recoveries, perhaps even more
strange than such a result would be in the case before
him. What now is his duty to his patient? Shall he tell
him the worst, as it is expressed, and thus extinguish his
rising hopes? Shall he say to him, “This very probably is
only a truce for a little while, and then your now dormant
disease will renew its attack, and perhaps with more vehemence;
and, even at this time, it may be secretly carrying
on the work of destruction, while the remedies are merely
administering to your comfort, and smoothing your passage
to the tomb?” To say nothing of the evil of such a course,
if the case be susceptible of a cure, it cannot be an advisable
one, if the prolongation of life and the alleviation of suffering
be objects worthy of the aim of the physician; for such
a course would in most cases have a strong tendency to
defeat the attainment of these objects. If the friends of
the patient deem it important that such a view of his case
should be presented to his mind, let them take the responsibility
of doing it themselves, and not call upon the physician
to do it. Ask not him to come to his patient with the look
and language of despair, and utterly dissever the idea of
hope from the efforts which he makes and the remedies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
which he administers. Put no such unnatural, and cheerless,
and, I may add, profitless office upon him.</p>

<p>I remember once being strongly urged to such a course
by the friends of a patient. Whilst apparently going
steadily down to the grave, his symptoms at length became
much relieved, and he took some encouragement from the state
of his case. In reply to the inquiry of his friends, whether
I had any hope of his recovery, I frankly said that I had
not, and that from all I could see I supposed that the relief
which he experienced was to last but a short time, and that
he must die very soon. They urged me to tell him so, but
I declined, for the reasons that I have stated above. The
condition of comfort and relief lasted in this case, contrary
to my expectation, for several weeks; and they were weeks
of delightful intercourse, of affectionate counsel, and of
triumphant faith and joy. And I have not a doubt that
his life was thus happily prolonged in part by the cordial
influence of the hope, that the remedies which relieved his
distress might effect a cure.</p>

<p>It seems to be the idea of some, that there is something
very salutary in a spiritual point of view in the knowledge
of the fact, that death is certain and near. That it is more
alarming and awakens more emotion than the mere idea of
danger, I allow; but that it is more apt to produce right
views and feelings is by no means satisfactorily proved.
Even if it be true, that the certainty of death is more likely
to secure decisive action in regard to the interests of
eternity, a decision under such circumstances is by no
means so worthy of confidence as one which is arrived at
when the hope of recovery is not wholly extinguished. To
test this, take as an example the feeling of resignation.
When death is seen to be absolutely certain, its very certainty
is apt to induce a sort of calm semi-fatalism, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
has the appearance of true submission, and is often mistaken
for it through the charity and fondness of friendship. But
when the result is seen to be uncertain, if there be amid all
the balancing of the mind between hope and fear a willingness
to acquiesce in the supreme will, there is good reason
to believe that the patient has a true Christian resignation.
There was much force in the remark of a patient, who had
for some days had the certain expectation of death, but
who had at length experienced so much relief, that there
was some ground for hope. “I am glad,” said she, “that
this relief has occurred, even if I do not recover; for now
I can fairly test the reality of my submission. I can put
life and death together, and examine my wishes and desires
in regard to them.”</p>

<p>There is one disease in which the disposition to hope is
so marked, that Dr. Good enumerates it among its symptoms.
I refer to consumption. In some cases, it is true,
this symptom does not appear, but despondency for the most
part prevails. But this arises either from a morbid sensitiveness
of the nervous system, or from a diseased condition
of the digestive organs. When neither of these circumstances
exists, and the disease is uncomplicated with other
maladies, the tendency to hope is so strong as often to resist
the force of the most decisive evidence. Nothing is more
common than to hear a consumptive patient say, “Doctor,
if you will only cure this cough, I shall be well,” as if the
cough were only a slight matter, and its continuance was
rather provoking than dangerous. I once saw a physician
deceiving himself to the last week of his life with the idea,
that his disease was in the stomach and liver, when there
was the most palpable evidence that the lungs, and the
lungs only, were diseased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span></p>

<p>This tendency to hope is beautifully alluded to in a poetical
sketch of consumption by an anonymous author:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then came Consumption with her languid moods,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her soothing whispers, and her dreams that seek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To muse themselves in silent solitudes:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She came with hectic glow, and wasted cheek,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And still the maiden pined more wan and weak,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pale like the second bow: <em>yet would she speak</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>The words of Hope, even while she passed away,</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>Amid the closing clouds, and faded ray by ray</em>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Shall this hope, delusive as it so commonly is, be demolished
by the physician? Clearly it, in most cases at least,
should not be. For in very many cases it manifestly prolongs
life, and adds to its comfort and its usefulness, and in
some cases it proves not to be as delusive as perhaps even
the physician is disposed to consider it. Recovery does
now and then occur in cases of true consumption, and even
in some which are quite advanced. The changes observed
by means of the stethoscope in the progress of some cases
which have ended in recovery, and the examinations of the
lungs of those who have died of some other malady, show
conclusively that tubercular consumption is not necessarily
a fatal disease. Every physician who has seen much of
this disease has occasionally witnessed facts confirmatory
of this statement.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In concluding this chapter I remark, that the obvious
rule in regard to the use to be made of hope as a curative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
agent is this—that its cordial influence should always be
employed, so far as it can be done consistently with truth,
and no farther. And the bare fact that a case has ended
fatally, when the physician has encouraged in the patient
the hope of a recovery, should by no means, as is often
done, be considered as proof that he has dealt falsely. He
may have encouraged the patient in good faith. For the
physician, however wise and skilful he may be, is not able
to foresee with any certainty the final event of sickness so
frequently as is commonly supposed, and in all doubtful
cases he is bound to give the patient the benefit of all the
hope of which the symptoms will admit.</p>



<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="label">[43]</a> The mortality of consumption has been undoubtedly increased by
the very prevalent, but erroneous, opinion, that when this disease has only
fairly begun it is never arrested, but sooner or later ends in death. The
definite opinions, too, sometimes given to the patient as to the supposed
hopelessness of the case, founded upon the revelations of the stethoscope
to the exclusion of other evidence, have produced the same effect.</p>

<span class="fs80">TRUTH IN OUR INTERCOURSE WITH THE SICK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>On the question, whether strict veracity should be adhered
to, in every case and under all circumstances, in our
intercourse with the sick, there is very great difference of
opinion, as well among medical men, as in the community
at large. Some are most scrupulously strict in their regard
to truth; others, while they are generally so, make some
few occasional exceptions in cases of great emergency and
necessity; while others still (and I regret to say that they
are very numerous) give themselves great latitude in their
practice, if they do not in their avowed opinions.</p>

<p>In examining this subject, it is not so much my intention
to discuss the abstract question, as to present the many
practical considerations that present themselves, illustrating
them, so far as is necessary, by facts and cases.</p>

<p>In order to introduce the subject, I will here quote a passage
from Percival’s Medical Ethics, which presents the
views of those who are in favor of an occasional departure
from truth, where the necessity of the case seems to demand
it.</p>

<p>“Every practitioner must find himself occasionally in
circumstances of very delicate embarrassment, with respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
to the contending obligations of veracity and professional
duty; and when such trials occur, it will behoove him to
act on fixed principles of rectitude, derived from previous
information and serious reflection. Perhaps the following
brief considerations, by which I have conscientiously endeavored
to govern my own conduct, may afford some aid
to his decision. Moral truth, in a professional view, has
two references; one to the party to whom it is delivered,
and another to the individual by whom it is uttered. In
the first it is a <em>relative duty</em>, constituting a branch of justice,
and may properly be regulated by the divine rule of
equity prescribed by our Saviour, <em>to do unto others as we
would</em>, all circumstances duly weighed, <em>they should do unto
us</em>. In the second it is a relative duty, regarding solely the
sincerity, the purity and the probity of the physician himself.
To a patient, therefore, perhaps the father of a numerous
family, or one whose life is of the highest importance
to the community, who makes inquiries, which, if faithfully
answered, might prove fatal to him, it would be a gross and
unfeeling wrong to reveal the truth. His right to it is suspended,
and even annihilated; because its beneficial nature
being reversed, it would be deeply injurious to himself, to
his family, and to the public. And he has the strongest
claim, from the trust reposed in his physician, as well as
from the common principle of humanity, to be guarded
against whatever would be detrimental to him. In such a
situation, therefore, the only point at issue is, whether the
practitioner shall sacrifice that delicate sense of veracity,
which is so ornamental to, and indeed forms a characteristic
excellence of the virtuous man, to this claim of professional
justice and social duty. Under such a painful
conflict of obligations, a wise and good man must be
governed by those which are the most imperious, and will,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
therefore, generously relinquish any consideration referable
only to himself. Let him be careful, however, not to do
this but in cases of real emergency, which, happily, seldom
occur, and to guard his mind sedulously against the injury
it may sustain by such violations of the native love of truth.
I shall conclude this long note with the two following very
interesting biographical facts. The husband of the celebrated
Arria, Cæcinna Pactus, was very dangerously ill.
Her son was also sick at the same time, and died. He was
a youth of uncommon accomplishments, and fondly beloved
by his parents. Arria prepared and conducted his funeral,
in such a manner, that her husband remained entirely ignorant
of the mournful event which occasioned that solemnity.
Pactus often inquired with anxiety about his son, to whom
she cheerfully replied, that he had slept well, and was better.
But if her tears, too long restrained, were bursting
forth, she instantly retired, to give vent to her grief, and
when again composed, returned to Pactus with dry eyes
and a placid countenance, quitting, as it were, all the tender
feelings of the mother at the threshold of her husband’s
chamber. Lady Russell’s only son, Wriothesley, Duke of
Bedford, died of the small-pox, in May, 1711, in the 31st
year of his age. To this affliction succeeded, in November,
1711, the loss of her daughter, the Duchess of Rutland.
Lady Russell, after seeing her in the coffin, went to
her other daughter, married to the Duke of Devonshire,
from whom it was necessary to conceal her grief, she being
at that time in childbed likewise; therefore she assumed a
cheerful air, and, with astonishing resolution, agreeable to
truth, answered her anxious daughter’s inquiries with these
words, ‘I have seen your sister out of bed to-day.’”</p>

<p>The falsehood in the two cases related by the author is
of the most egregious character, and yet they are fair representations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
of that kind of deception which many feel authorized
to use in the sick room. The equivocation which is
practised, it is true, is not always as gross and as labored,
but it is as real. And whatever be the degree or kind of
deception, the same principles will apply to every case.</p>

<p>The question that presents itself is not, let it be understood,
whether the truth shall in any case be <em>withheld</em>, but
whether, in doing this, real falsehood is justifiable, in any
form, whether direct or indirect, whether palpable or in the
shape of equivocation.</p>

<p>And we may also remark, that the question is not, whether
those who practice deception upon the sick are guilty
of a criminal act. This depends altogether on the motive
which prompts it, and it is certainly often done from the
best and kindest motives. The question is stripped of all
considerations of this nature, and comes before us as a
simple practical question—whether there are any cases in
which, for the sake of benefitting our fellow men, perhaps
even to the saving of life, it is proper to make an exception
to the great general law of truth.</p>

<p>The considerations which will bring us to a clear and
undoubted decision of this question, are not all to be drawn
from the preciousness of the principle of truth, as an unbroken,
invariable, and ever-present principle, the soul of all
order, and confidence, and happiness, in the wide universe.
But the principle of expediency also furnishes us with some
considerations that are valuable in confirming our decision,
if not in leading us to it. In truth, expediency and right
always correspond, and would be seen to do so, if we could
always see the end from the beginning.</p>

<p>I will remark upon each of the considerations as I
present them.</p>

<p>First. It is erroneously assumed by those who advocate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
deception, that the knowledge to be concealed from the
patient would, if communicated, be essentially injurious to
him. Puffendorf remarks in relation to this point, that
“when a man is desirous, and it is his duty, to do a piece
of service, he is not bound to take measures that will <em>certainly</em>
render his attempts unsuccessful.” The certainty
of the result, thus taken for granted, is far from being warranted
by facts. Even in some cases where there was a
strong probability (and this is all we can have in any case)
that the effect would be hurtful, it has been found not to be
so. I might here narrate some cases to prove the truth of
this assertion, but it is not necessary. Suffice it to say,
that it is confirmed by the experience of every physician
who has pursued a frank and candid course in his intercourse
with the sick.</p>

<p>Secondly. It is also erroneously assumed that concealment
can always or generally be effectually carried out.
There are so many ways by which the truth can be betrayed,
even where concerted plans are laid, guarded at every
point, that failure is much more common than success, so
far as my observation has extended. Some unguarded expression
or act, even on the part of those who are practising
the concealment, or some information communicated by
those who are not in the secret, perhaps by children, or
some evidence casually seen, very often either reveals the
truth, or awakens suspicion and prompts inquiry which the
most skilful equivocation may not be able to elude. The
very air that is assumed in carrying on the deception often
defeats the object. In one instance where this was the
case, the suspecting patient said very significantly, ‘How
strangely you all seem—you act as if something dreadful
had happened that you mean to keep from me.’ Even the
little child often exhibits a most correct discrimination in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
detecting deception in the manner, the modes of expression,
and even the very tone of the voice. And sometimes, nay
very often, people so far undervalue the good sense and
shrewdness of children, that their deception is even ridiculously
bungling, and justly excites an honest indignation in
the bosom of the deceived child.</p>

<p>I give the following scene as an illustration of the above
remark.</p>

<p>‘Come, take this,’ said a mother to her child, ‘it’s something
good.’</p>

<p>The child was evidently a little suspicious that he was
not dealt with candidly; but after a great many assurances
from her on whom a child ought to be able to rely, if upon
any body in the wide world, he was at length persuaded to
take the spoon into his mouth. The medicine, which was
really very bitter, was at once spit out, and the little fellow
burst forth in reproaches upon his mother for telling him
such a lie.</p>

<p>‘No, my dear,’ said she, ‘I have told you no lie. The
medicine <em>is</em> good—it is good to cure you. That is what I
meant.’</p>

<p>‘Good to cure me!’ cried he, with a look and an air of
the most perfect contempt. ‘You cheated me. You <em>know</em>
you did.’</p>

<p>The contempt which this child manifested towards such
barefaced equivocation was most justly merited, and yet
this is a fair example of the deceptions which physicians
are almost every day obliged to witness, and which, (may
I not say?) some of them encourage both by precept and
example.</p>

<p>Thirdly. If the deception be discovered or suspected, the
effect upon the patient is much worse than a frank and full
statement of the truth can produce. If disagreeable news,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
for example, be concealed from him, there is very great
danger that it will in some way be revealed to him so
abruptly and unexpectedly, as to give him a severe shock,
which can for the most part be avoided when the communication
is made voluntarily. And then, too, the very fact
that the truth has been withheld, increases, for obvious
reasons, this shock. I will relate a case as an example. It
occurred during the prevalence of an epidemic. A lady
was taken sick and died. The fact of her death was
studiously concealed from another lady of her acquaintance,
who was liable to be attacked by the same disease. She
was supposed by her to be doing well, until one day a child
from a neighboring family accidentally alluded to the
death of her friend in her presence. The shock which the
sad news thus communicated produced upon her was
almost overwhelming, and it was of course rendered more
intense by the reflection, that her friends thought her to be
exceedingly in danger of dying of the prevailing disease,
and therefore had practised this concealment in order to quiet
her apprehensions. She soon followed her friend, and it is
not an improbable supposition, that the strong impression thus
made upon her mind had some agency in causing her death.</p>

<p>In another case of a similar character, the first intimation
which a lady had of the death of a friend was from seeing
the husband of this friend pass in the street with a badge of
mourning. She was immediately prostrated upon her bed,
and was a long time in recovering from the shock.</p>

<p>In both of these cases the concealment of the truth was
prompted by the best of motives—pure kindness; and yet
nothing is more plain than that it was a <em>mistaken</em> kindness.
Whatever may be true in other instances, the result showed
this to be the fact in these two cases. And if it be true, as
I think all experience will prove, that success, and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
failure, in the attempt at concealment, is the exception to
the general fact, it clearly follows that deception is impolitic
as a measure of kindness, and therefore, aside from any
other consideration, it should be wholly discarded in our
intercourse with the sick.</p>

<p>I have a case in mind, which exhibits in contrast the
influence of frankness and of deception.</p>

<p>A little girl, the daughter of a farmer, had her arm torn
to pieces up to the elbow in a threshing machine constructed
very much like a picker. As her mother was confined to
her bed with severe sickness, the child was carried into the
house of a neighbor. When I arrived, I was told that her
mother was in great distress, and fears were expressed that
the accident would have a very bad influence upon her
case. I asked if she knew what had happened. ‘No,’ said
her husband, ‘not exactly. She found out by the children
that Mary was hurt, and then sent for me, and asked me
what was the matter. I told her at first that she had got
her finger hurt. She said she knew that was not all, and I
at length, after she had begged and begged me to tell all,
told her that her hand was hurt badly. And now she is
crying most piteously, and says that we are deceiving her,
and that she knows that Mary is almost killed.’</p>

<p>I immediately went in to see the mother, and found her
indeed almost distracted with the great variety of dread
visions that had suggested themselves to her fancy in regard
to her darling child. As I entered the room she cried out,
‘Oh, she’s dead, doctor, or dying—torn to pieces—in agony—Oh,
isn’t it so? tell me, tell me the truth!’ ‘Be quiet,’ said
I, ‘and I <em>will</em> tell you all the truth. I will not deceive you.’
I assured her that she need give herself no anxiety about
the <em>life</em> of her child—that was safe. This announcement
quieted her in a good measure, and I went on to tell her that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
the arm was badly torn, and that I must amputate it above
the elbow. I told her that this would take but a minute or
two, and then the child would be essentially well. It was
necessary to go into these particulars in answer to her
inquiries, (which were the more minute from the fact that she
had been deceived,) or else I should forfeit her confidence,
and thus commit the same error that had already been
committed. She thanked me for being so frank with her,
and said, that though it was hard to think of the operation,
she could bear that, if the child’s life was only spared. She
grieved still, it is true; but there was none of that overwhelming
distraction that results from vague apprehension.</p>

<p>Fourthly. The destruction of confidence, resulting from
discovered deception, is productive of injurious consequences
to the persons deceived. The moment that you
are detected in deceiving the sick, you at once impair or
even destroy their confidence in your veracity and frankness.
Everything that you do afterward is suspected, and
a full and unshrinking trust is not accorded to you even
when you deserve it, though you may try to obtain it by
the most positive and solemn assurances. If, for example,
you wish to encourage a patient, and you tell him that
though the bow of hope is dim to his eye, it is bright to
your own: ‘Ah!’ he will think, if he does not say, ‘how do
I know but that it is as dim to him as it looks to me—he
has deceived me once, and perhaps he does now.’</p>

<p>Every physician has seen the injurious influence of
deception upon children. Sometimes it is of a most disastrous
character, and occasionally, I have not a doubt, it
proves fatal. Deception is more frequently practiced upon
children than upon adults, and many seem to think that
they have not the same right to candor and honesty in our
intercourse with them. But a child can appreciate fair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
and honest treatment as well as an adult can, and he has
as good a right to receive it at our hands. He sometimes
claims this right in terms, and by acts not to be mistaken.
And when it is taken from him, he shows his sense of the
wrong by remonstrances and retaliatory language, and by
a system of rebellion to an authority which he despises, as
well as fears, for its falsehood.</p>

<p>Suppose a mother succeeds in giving a dose of medicine
by stratagem, the administration of every dose after it is
accompanied with a fearful struggle. The strife which
results from the spirit of resistance thus engendered, perhaps
in the beginning of a long sickness, and which might
in most cases have been avoided by frank and candid treatment,
continues through the whole course of the disease to
the last hour of life if the case prove fatal, the little creature
feebly but obstinately resisting its mother, till the exhaustion
of coming death puts an end to its struggles; and, though
she plies every art that fondness can devise to win back the
lost confidence of her darling child, it is all in vain.</p>

<p>If the reader have any adequate idea of the importance
of quietness in the management of the sick, I need not
spend time to prove, that this resistance of the sick child
has an injurious effect upon the disease, and that in those
cases where life has but a feeble trembling hold, where the
silver cord is worn down almost to its last thread, such a
struggle may break that thread by its violence. I have not
a doubt that many a child has died under such circumstances,
that might otherwise have recovered.</p>

<p>Let me not be understood to imply that the resistance
made by children to the administration of medicine is invariably
the result of deception practised upon them, though
this is the cause undoubtedly in quite a large proportion of
the cases, and those too of the worst and most unconquerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
character. And it may be remarked, that in many
cases this may be the cause of the difficulty where it is little
suspected. For it is so common a habit to deceive children
in this matter, that it is often done unconsciously. But
though the parent may not remember it, the child does, and
the cruel oppressive act (for so it may be properly called)
locked up in the memory of the child, wakes up rebellion in
his heart that is not easily quelled. Many a parent has
thus in a moment, for the sake of a slight temporary advantage,
sown the wind to reap the whirlwind.</p>

<p>Deception has very often been made use of in the management
of the insane, though recently not to the same
extent that it once was. The consideration which I have
been illustrating and enforcing lies against the practice of
it in our intercourse with this unfortunate class of patients,
with the greater force, because in their case the mind is
diseased, and any bad mental influence has therefore a
worse effect than it would have upon a case of mere bodily
disease. The reason is obvious—it acts directly upon the
seat of the disease in the former case, but indirectly in the
latter.</p>

<p>Besides, let the insane man once see that you have deceived
him, and you lose the principal, perhaps we may say
the only, moral means that you have for curing his malady.
Confidence is essential to any good moral influence that
you may exert upon him. I might cite many facts to prove
this, but will advert to only one. The wife of an insane
man was the only person among all his friends that had any
control over him, and she could manage him with perfect
ease. After his recovery she asked him the reason of this
fact, and his reply was, ‘You was the only one that uniformly
told me the truth?</p>

<p>The bad influence of deception upon the insane man is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
rendered the more certain and effectual from the fact that
his insanity incapacitates him for appreciating the kind
motives which may have prompted the deception. You
cannot convince him as you can the sane sick man, that
you have deceived him for his own good. His suspicious
eye sees nothing but a sinister purpose in the cheat which
you have practised upon him.</p>

<p>One of the most vivid recollections of my childhood is
that of a scene which illustrates these remarks. A poor
crazy man who wandered about the streets was thought to
have become dangerous, and it was proposed to confine him
in the common jail. A plan was laid to do it by stratagem.
He fancied himself to own some large possessions, and
talked much about going to Boston to see his friend the
governor, and attend to his business there. A neighbor
offered to go with him, and he accepted the offer. As they
passed by the jail, his friend proposed to visit it. As they
entered one of the cells he adroitly slipped out, and the
door was closed upon the insane man. His dream of earthly
happiness and wealth was in a moment at an end, and he
beheld himself the victim of base treachery in the narrow
cell of a prison. Never shall I forget how eloquently he
pleaded for his release, how he asked what crime could be
charged to his account, how he denounced those who had
thus without cause shut him up like a felon, and especially
with what sorrowful but burning indignation he spoke of
the man, ‘who under the guise of friendship, had decoyed
him into this snare of his enemies.’ Though a mere boy, I
pitied him. I sympathised with him. I had known
him only as a pleasant old man, who used to amuse us
as we met him in the streets with stories of his immense
wealth and of the splendid plans of building on which
he loved to speculate. I felt that it was wrong to confine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
him among vile criminals, and wondered not that the
keen sense of such injury prompted to the utterance of
curses on those who inflicted it. But these natural feelings
gave way in my bosom, as they did in older ones,
to what was then supposed to be the necessity of the
case—a necessity which, I rejoice to say, has since that
been found not to exist in similar cases. A very great improvement
has been effected in this as well as in other
respects, in the management of the insane. Most of those
whom it was once thought necessary to confine with bolts
and bars, and perhaps chains, and upon whom deception
was continually and systematically practised, thus adding
poignancy to the pangs of the oppressed spirit, are now
permitted to have so much liberty, that they are cheerful
and happy, reposing entire confidence in their attendants,
who are careful never to deceive them. And those whom
it is thought necessary to confine, are not doomed to the
cheerlessness and disgrace of the cell of the felon, but they
are placed in as agreeable circumstances as is consistent
with safety. And it has come to be an established rule
with those who have the care of the insane, that force is
always preferable to deception. But still, erroneous views
are very prevalent in the community on this subject. It
is common to this day, even among the excellent and well
informed, to propose to send their insane friends to a Retreat
by stratagem, and this has often been done even by the
advice of physicians. So far as I recollect, in all the cases
of insanity that have gone to Retreats from under my care,
this mode of management has been spoken of by some, and
generally by many, as the only proper mode. The public
need to be instructed and reformed on this point.</p>

<p>It is a common observation that the insane are apt to
look upon their best and most intimate friends as their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
enemies. Why is this? It is clear, that it is in part to be
ascribed to the influence of deception, waking up, as might
be expected, feelings of resentment and enmity in the bosom
of the insane, which would not otherwise be there. This
point I have commented upon in the Chapter on Insanity,
and I need not dwell upon it here.</p>

<p>The extent to which deception is practised upon the
insane cannot be fully appreciated, except by those whose
attention has been specially called to this subject. As I
have already remarked in regard to children, so also it is
with the insane—deception is so common, that people often
make use of it almost unconsciously. The whole course of
management on the part of their friends, is often characterized
throughout by an absence of candor and veracity.</p>

<p>The tendency of such a course is invariably to increase
insanity, making it more intense and obstinate. And not
only so, but it modifies to a greater or less degree its character.
Deception prompts the insane man to exercise his
ingenuity in forming plans to foil and circumvent his deceivers,
whom he supposes very naturally to be his enemies.
Of course, new feelings and thoughts are thus excited in his
bosom, giving in some measure a new cast to his insanity.</p>

<p>I will here relate a case that illustrates these remarks.</p>

<p>The friends of an insane gentleman determined to send
him to a Retreat by stratagem. For this purpose, he was
induced by one of them to go a journey with him. On,
their way, his friend proposed to him to visit an Insane Retreat
as a matter of curiosity. When they arrived there,
he was given to understand that he was to remain as an
inmate. Great was his rage at being so grossly deceived.
After the first burst of indignation was passed, he saw that
it was of no use to say anything or to make any resistance.
He was a shrewd man, and therefore, as a matter of policy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
he submitted with apparent cheerfulness to his new situation.
He did not forget, as the insane sometimes fortunately
do, the wrong which his friends had done him, and
as he was decoyed there by stratagem, it is no wonder that
he at length made his escape by stratagem also. He came
out, as might have been expected, with his insanity more
thoroughly fixed than it was when he went in, and he added
to it a deep hatred of Retreats, and of course of the man
who had betrayed him into one.</p>

<p>Another attempt was made to carry him to the same
Retreat, which from mismanagement utterly failed. The
insane man was victorious, and he felt himself to be so, over
his friends, who he supposed were bent upon cheating and
oppressing him. All this not only made him more crazy, but
it gave a new shape to his insane ideas. In a conversation
which I chanced to have with him, he said to me, ‘It is
perfectly evident, doctor, that these Insane Retreats are
joint-stock institutions, and the stockholders are chiefly
lawyers and doctors and ministers. And it’s good stock
too. Just see how much they charge for board—full double
at least of the actual expenses. I need not tell you anything
about it, however, for you own some of this stock, and
you know how profitable it is to you.’</p>

<p>‘Oh no,’ said I, ‘this is all new to me.’ He looked at me
as if he would look me through. He had been deceived so
much, that he believed, he trusted no one. Although I gave
him the most positive assurance that I owned no such stock,
still, in spite of the confidence which he ordinarily reposed
in me, he showed that he did after all suspect me on this
point, so firmly was this notion about Retreats fastened in
his mind. He went on to give his reasons for his opinion.</p>

<p>‘I can look back,’ said he, ‘to my very childhood, and see
that from that time to the present, there has been a series<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
of efforts on the part of these stockholders to make me a
crazy man; and they at length succeeded, and then contrived
the mean plan of tricking me into one of their Retreats.
The minister that I lived with when I was ten years
old began this scheme, and all the ministers and lawyers
and doctors, that I have had anything to do with since that
time, have had a hand in it—have exerted their influence
on me, all in relation to this one object. It’s a regular
money-making business. Of course the stockholders all
want to see these Retreats well filled up. Just see how
they have treated me lately. They have combined to cross
my purposes, break up my plans, defeat my projects, ruin
my business, and all this to irritate and disappoint me, and
thus craze me. And then, to cap the whole, they lied to
me and betrayed me into their prison to die a slow death,
paying them all the time about twelve dollars a week. Good
stock, doctor, but a cruel business,’ said he, with a most
unearthly grin, and a shudder that shook his whole frame.
‘But thank heaven,’ cried he, ‘I’ve escaped their clutches.
Though they have ruined me, they shall not have their
twelve dollars a week out of me. No, I’ll die first. Such
systematic, cheating, lying oppression, I’ll resist to the
death.’</p>

<p>It is evident that the treatment which this man received
at the hands of his friends, tended to aggravate, instead of lessening
his insanity. And I may remark, too, that the notion
which he derived from this treatment, in relation to Retreats,
false as it was, was founded on more plausible reasons
as they were presented to his mind, than are some of the
opinions that are adopted by some sane men in the community.</p>

<p>Fifthly. The <em>general</em> effect of deception, aside from the
individual which it is supposed it will benefit, is injurious.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
The considerations on which I have already remarked, have
had regard entirely to the person that is deceived, and I
think that I have shown most clearly, that even taking this
narrow view of the influence of deception, it is in almost
all cases a bad influence: and therefore as we cannot tell
in what cases this influence will be good, it is impolitic, and
should be entirely discarded. Let us now go farther, and
looking beyond the individuals who are the subjects of the
deception, we shall see its influence extending all around
from these individuals, as so many radiating points of influence,
leavening the whole mass of society with a most poisonous
leaven. It is not an influence that can be shut up
in the case of any individual, in that one breast, or within
that one chamber of sickness.</p>

<p>That confidence, which should always exist in the intercourse
of the sick with their physicians and friends, and
which may be made the channel of great and essential benefits
to them, is materially impaired, often even destroyed
by such deception. And this effect is unfortunately not
confined to those who practice it, but the imputation rests
upon others. The distrust thus produced often exerts a
depressing influence in those cases, where the cordial influence
of hope is most urgently needed, and where it can be
administered in consonance with the most scrupulous veracity.
It is well if, under such circumstances, the physician
can appeal to the patient’s own experience of his frankness
in all his previous intercourse with him.</p>

<p>I call to mind an instance in which I was able to make
this appeal with the most marked good effect. The patient
was a lady who was in a great state of alarm in regard to
the probable result of her sickness. She was indeed very
sick, but there was good reason to hope that remedies would
relieve her. At the same time I feared that the depressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
effect of this state of alarm, if it should continue, would
prove a serious obstacle to her recovery. But as I expressed
to her the confident hope that she would get well, she
said to me, ‘Physicians always talk in this way, and you
do not really mean as you say. I shall die, I know that I
shall die.’ I had been the physician of the family for many
years, during which time they had gone through some trying
scenes of sickness. Alluding to all this, I asked her
if she could look back and call to mind a single instance
in which I had not dealt candidly and frankly with her.
She allowed that she could not. ‘Well,’ said I, ‘believe
me <em>now</em>; I <em>am</em> in earnest; I do believe, and confidently,
too, that you will recover.’ The tears were at once wiped
away. Cheerfulness, the cheerfulness of hope, lighted up
her countenance and the case went on to a speedy and full
recovery.</p>

<p>Every day we see evidence of the fact that so large a
proportion of the medical profession practice deception upon
the sick, that the profession, as a whole, has to a greater or
less degree the imputation fastened upon it. Indeed patients
often, as a matter of course, make the distinction between
the obligations to professional veracity, and those of the
man, as a man, in his ordinary intercourse; and the physician,
who has an established reputation for the strictest
veracity everywhere else but in the sick chamber, has there
the suspicion of deception put upon him; and it is supposed
to be no imputation of which he should complain, because
deception is allowed here almost by general permission.
For this reason, whatever of frankness and honesty there
may be in our intercourse with the sick, often fails to produce
the effect intended, in part at least if not wholly. And
this result follows just in proportion to the extent to which
deception is made use of in the profession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span></p>

<p>The indirect and collateral effects of deception are often
manifest in a family of children. Its influence extends beyond
the mind and character of the deceived child. If the
other children witness the deception, what hinders them
from believing that their parents can deceive them also
whenever it suits their convenience? And if they do not
witness it, the sick child will remember it when he recovers,
and the rebellion which he has, in consequence, in his bosom
towards an authority that rules by deceit, and is therefore
deemed with good reason oppressive, is of course communicated
to the other bosoms of the little flock. Many a
parent, who supposed that he was doing nothing that would
last beyond the present moment, has thus sown the seeds of
rebellion among the little band of subjects, over whom God
has placed him; and who can tell what the fruits will be, or
to what extent or length of time they will grow!</p>

<p>I need barely say in concluding my remarks on this consideration,
that the momentary good which occasionally
results to <em>individual</em> cases from deception, is not to be put
in comparison, for one moment, with the vast and permanent
evils of a <em>general</em> character, that almost uniformly
proceed from a breach of the great law of truth. And there
is no warrant to be found for shutting our eyes to these
general and remote results, in our earnestness to secure a
particular and present good, however precious that good
may be—a plain principle, and yet how often it is disregarded.</p>

<p>Sixthly. If it be adopted by the community as a common
rule, that the truth may be sacrificed in urgent cases,
the very object of the deception will be defeated. For
why is it that deception succeeds in any case? It is because
the patient supposes that all who have intercourse
with him deal with him truthfully—that no such common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
rule has been adopted. There is even now, while the policy
on this subject is unsettled and matter of dispute, enough
distrust produced to occasion trouble. And if it should
become a settled policy under an acknowledged common
rule, the result would be <em>general</em> distrust, of course defeating
deception at every point. And yet if it be proper to
deceive, then most clearly is it proper to proclaim it as an
adopted principle of action. Else we are driven to the
absurd proposition, that while it is right to practice deception,
it is wrong to say to the world that it is right.</p>

<p>It is in vain to say that the evil result which would attend
this adoption of occasional deception, as the settled policy
of the medical profession, would find a correction in the
very terms of the rule which should be adopted, viz. that
the case must be an urgent one to warrant deception, and
there must be a fair prospect that it can be carried through
without discovery. For every patient, that was aware of
the adoption of such a rule, might and often probably would
suspect that his own case is considered as coming within
the terms of the rule.</p>

<p>Seventhly. Once open the door for deception, and you
can prescribe for it no definite limits. Every one is to be
left to judge for himself. And as present good is the object
for which the truth is to be sacrificed, the amount of good,
for which it is proper to do it, can not be fixed upon with
any exactness. Each one is left to make his own estimate,
and the limit is in each one’s private judgment, in each
one’s individual case as it arises. And the limit, which is at
first perhaps quite narrow, is apt to grow wider, till the
deception may get to be of the very worst and most injurious
character. I will give a single illustration of this
remark, which though not taken from the practice of medicine,
is appropriate to my purpose. It has always been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
allowed in the laws of war, to deceive the enemy by stratagems,
false lights, &amp;c. At one time some English ships
in two or three instances decoyed the enemy by counterfeiting
signals of distress. The deception in this case is
productive indirectly of the very worst consequences, for it
manifestly tends to prevent relief from being afforded to
those, who are actually in a distressed condition. Our feelings
of humanity instinctively condemn such a stratagem
and yet it is only a mere extension of that deception, which
has been by common consent allowed in war. It involves
no different principles, and is only more objectionable, because
it produces worse indirect results. It differs in degree
only and not in kind.</p>

<p>So it is with deception always. Its indirect effects are
always bad to some extent, and to what extent they will
prove so we know not in each individual case. You can
never know at the time how great is the sacrifice which you
are making for a present good. While you may be thinking
that you are only sacrificing your own veracity, and
that the influence of the act will not extend beyond the
passing moment, you may be producing disastrous results
upon the interests of others, and those results may be both
lasting and accumulative. A man who was captured by
some Indians, was asked by them if there were any white
men in the neighborhood. He told them that there were,
and directed them to a spot where he was very certain that
there were none. They immediately started in pursuit,
leaving him bound and in the charge of one of their number.
When they were gone, he contrived to make his
escape. Almost every one would say, that this was a strong
case, and that they could not blame him for telling a falsehood
to Indians, in order to escape from their cruelty. Here
was a great good to be obtained, the saving himself from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
torture, perhaps from death, and deceiving savages for such
a purpose, it will be said, is not to be condemned. But
mark the result of that deception. Five white men were
found on the spot to which he directed them, and were captured.</p>

<p>In order to make out a justification of deception, on the
ground of expediency in any case, all the possible results,
direct and indirect, must be taken into the account. But
this is impossible except to omniscience itself. Even in
those cases which appear the most clear to us, there may
be consequences of the most grave character utterly hidden
from our view. In the instance just related, the captive
was very certain, from some circumstances, that he directed
his captors to a spot where there were no white
men.</p>

<p>The uncertainty of our knowledge of the circumstances
of each case prevents then our defining any limits, within
which deception shall be bounded. We can make no accurate
distinctions, which will enable us to say, that it can be
beneficially employed in one case, while in another it will
be inexpedient.</p>

<p>I have now finished the examination of the various considerations
which have been suggested to my mind in
relation to this subject. And I think that they settle the
question as to the expediency of deception beyond all doubt.
I think it perfectly evident, that the good, which may be
done by deception in a <em>few</em> cases, is almost as nothing, compared
with the evil which it does in <em>many</em> cases, when the
prospect of its doing good was just as promising as it was
in those in which it succeeded. And when we add to this
the evil which would result from a <em>general</em> adoption of a
system of deception, the importance of a strict adherence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
to truth in our intercourse with the sick, even on the ground
of expediency, becomes incalculably great.</p>

<p>In the passage, which I quoted in the beginning of this
article from Percival’s Medical Ethics, the writer makes, I
conceive, a false issue on the question under consideration.
He assumes that the injury, which results from a sacrifice
of the truth for the good of the sick, comes upon him who
practices the deception, and that in doing it, “he generously
relinquishes every consideration referable only to
himself.” But the considerations that I have presented
show, that the injury is very far from being thus confined.
Often the very person intended to be benefited is injured,
perhaps deeply, in some cases even fatally. And then the
indirect effects can not be estimated.</p>

<p>There are many illustrations, used by those who advocate
deception, which are plausible but fallacious. I will
cite a single example. Dr. Hutcheson of Glasgow, as
quoted by Dr. Percival, in remarking on the maxim, that
we must not do evil that good may come, says, “Must one
do nothing for a good purpose, which would have been evil
without this reference? It is evil to hazard life without a
view of some good; but when it is necessary for a public
interest, it is very lovely and honorable. It is criminal to
expose a good man to danger for nothing; but it is just
even to force him into the greatest dangers for his country.
It is criminal to occasion any pain to innocent persons,
without a view to some good; but for restoring of health
we reward chirurgeons for scarifyings, burnings, and amputations.”</p>

<p>I would remark on this that the infliction of pain is not
in itself a moral act, but the purpose for which it is done
gives it all the moral character that it has. Aside from
this, it affects no moral principle, as the infliction of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
injury upon truth certainly does, independent of the object
for which it is done. The infliction of pain then for a
good purpose can not be said to be doing evil that good
may come—it is doing good.</p>

<p>The sacrifice of life which the writer speaks of, is the
sacrifice of a less good for a greater one simply, and not the
sacrifice of any principle. But when the truth is sacrificed
for what is deemed to be a greater good, it is in fact the
sacrifice of a greater good, for not only a less, but an uncertain
good—a sacrifice of the eternal principle, which binds
together the moral universe in harmony, for a mere temporary
good, which after all may prove to be a shadow
instead of a reality.</p>

<p>I can not leave this subject without making some explanations
of a few points, in order to guard against some
erroneous inferences to which the sentiments that I have
advanced might otherwise be liable.</p>

<p>I wish not to be understood as saying that we should
never take pains to withhold knowledge from the sick,
which we fear might be injurious to them. There are
cases in which this should be done. All that I claim is
this—that in withholding the truth no deception should be
practised, and that if sacrifice of the truth be the necessary
price for obtaining the object, no such sacrifice should be
made. In the passage which I have quoted from Dr. Percival,
he states a case in which he very properly says, that
the patient’s right to the truth is suspended; but I do not
agree with him, that in withholding the truth we have the
right to <em>put absolute falsehood in its place</em>.</p>

<p>It is always a question of expediency simply, whether the
truth ought to be withheld. And it is a question that
depends, for its proper decision, upon a variety of considerations
in each individual case. It is very often decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
injudiciously. There is generally too great a readiness to
adopt an affirmative decision. It is too easily taken for
granted, that the knowledge in question will do harm to the
patient if it be communicated to him. The obvious rule on
this subject is this—that the truth should not be withheld
unless there be a reasonable prospect of effectually preventing
a discovery of it, and that too by fair and honest means.</p>

<p>It has often been said that the physician has no right to
excite too much hope in the mind of a patient by directing
his attention, as is often done, to any favorable symptoms
that may appear in his case. But I ask, how is it known
that in the case in relation to which this remark is made,
too much hope is excited? The physician is fallible, and
is by no means answerable for putting just the right degree
of hope into the patient’s bosom. It is not to be expected
of him that he shall always tell each patient just how his
case stands. His own mind is often filled with conflicting
hopes and fears, and he cannot decide clearly what the
probabilities are in many cases. And if he thinks that he
can do so, he may be very much mistaken. Estimates are
often made most unwarrantably. An exactness is often
aimed at which is impracticable. The patient in many
cases has no right to such an estimate, for while it may be
a mere guess, he may look upon it as a well-founded estimate,
made upon a real knowledge of his case. He will
therefore draw false inferences from it, and this the physician
is bound to prevent, and in so doing he actually prevents
deception.</p>

<p>The physician should always remember that though he
may be aware himself of his liability to err in making any
such estimate, the patient may have such confidence in his
judgment, that he will consider the opinion which he may
express to be of course a correct one—almost beyond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
possibility of a mistake. So that however guarded he may
be in expressing an unfavorable opinion of the probable
issue of any case, that opinion may have too much weight
in the patient’s mind.</p>

<p>It is by no means true that all direct questions on the
part of the sick must be directly and fully answered. For
example, suppose the patient asks the physician, “Do you
think on the whole that I shall recover”—a question that is
sometimes asked under very embarrassing circumstances.
If the physician thinks that he will probably not recover, he
has no right to say to him that he will, for this would be
falsehood. But he has a right, and it is his duty if he thinks
it for the good of the patient, to withhold his opinion from
him, if he can do it without falsehood or equivocation. He
may say to him something like this: “It is difficult to
decide that question. Perhaps it is not proper for me at
this stage of your case to attempt to do it. You are very
sick, and the issue of your sickness is known only to God.
I hope that remedies will do so and so (pointing out somewhat
the effects ordinarily to be expected) but I cannot
tell.” Something of this kind, varied according to the
nature of each case, especially in the amount of hope communicated,
it is perfectly consistent with truth and good
faith to say; and very often when more is said, even in
very dangerous cases, the physician goes beyond the limits
which infinite wisdom has thought best to set to his knowledge.
It is very common, as the reader has already seen
in the preceding chapter, for persons to recover, particularly
in cases of acute disease, when the physician had supposed
that they would die. This fact should make him
somewhat cautious in giving definite opinions to the sick
in relation to the probable final result of their sickness.</p>

<span class="fs80">MORAL INFLUENCE OF PHYSICIANS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The relation which the physician sustains to the community
is a peculiar one. No other man has so free access to
so many families among all classes of society. He is admitted
into the very bosom of the families upon which he
attends, even of those that receive other visitors with a
distant formality. So much is this the case, that most persons
have the feeling that their physician is a sort of confidant,
and on that ground they are willing that he should
see and hear, in his daily intercourse with them, what
would be improper to be seen and heard without the confidence
of intimate friendship. And when that confidence
is abused, as it sometimes is by the tattling and the unprincipled
physician, how gross the abuse, and how keenly is it
felt by those who have, as a matter of necessity, reposed
the confidence! I say as a matter of necessity, for the very
nature of the intercourse of the physician with his patients
is such as to make this confidence necessary. And the
necessity is recognised by both parties. The physician
knows that it is expected of him, that he will pay the most
scrupulous regard to the principles of honor which have
relation to this necessity, and that any discovered infraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
of them on his part will materially injure his professional
character. He feels this instinctively; and it is this feeling
which is generally an effectual safeguard against abuse of
confidence, when the patient chances to be under the care
of a physician who is devoid of moral principle.</p>

<p>In the above remarks, I do not refer merely to the secrets
which, either from choice, or necessity, are so often entrusted
to the physician by his patients. But I refer to the confidential
character which marks his <em>whole</em> intercourse with
them, extending to all the little nameless acts which makeup
that intercourse. He enters the dwelling of the sick as if
he were one of the family, and the very office that he is to
perform disarms all formality, and pre-supposes intercourse
of the most familiar character. The patient is to speak to
him not of a foreign subject, nor of some one else, but of
himself, of his own body, of its pains and ailments, and
that too with sufficient minuteness to communicate an adequate
knowledge of his case. In doing so, he calls into
exercise not only the scientific acumen of the <em>physician</em>,
but, mingled with this, the sympathy of the confidential
<em>friend</em>. If he has been the physician of the family for any
length of time, and has been with them in many scenes of
suffering, ready to relieve, so far as in him lay the power to
do it, this feeling of affectionate reliance is deep and ardent;
so much so, that it is a severe trial to the sensitive mind to
be obliged to consult a stranger, even though there be nothing
in the case to disturb the most refined and scrupulous
delicacy. Especially is this so when the patient is a female.
In her case the confidence reposed is of the most sacred
character. And shame be to the physician who dares to
trifle with it—who dares to offend in any way the delicacy
of a patient, whom necessity has placed in such near relationship
to him. It is principally this relationship, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
the physician holds to the mothers and daughters of the
families upon which he attends, that introduces him, if he
be a man of honor and principle, as the esteemed and loved
friend into the very <em>bosom</em> of those families.</p>

<p>One circumstance, that makes the intercourse of the
physician with his patients familiar and intimate, which I
have as yet barely hinted at, merits a more particular notice.
I refer to the sympathy which he has felt with them
in their seasons of suffering, anxiety, and affliction. It
has sometimes been said, that the physician, from his familiarity
with scenes of distress, becomes unfeeling, and incapable
of sympathizing with others. This may be true of
him, if he from the first look at the sufferings of his fellow-men
only as a source of emolument to himself. If at the
onset he enthrones this perfectly selfish and therefore hardening
principle in his bosom, he will of course become
devoid of sympathy and benevolence. But if he does not
this strange violence to his natural sympathies, but lets them
flow out, as he goes forth on his daily errands of relief and
mercy to high and low, to rich and poor, and especially if
he be faithful to the poor who can give him nothing but
their blessing and their prayers, his sympathy and kindness
will be so often drawn out, and under such a variety of circumstances,
that they will become more tender and active,
instead of being blunted and repressed. True, he will not
have that mawkish sensibility which vents itself in tears,
and sighs, and expressions of pity, but stops short of action,
or, if it ever reaches forth its hand, does it but fitfully, and
with none of that steadiness so essential in giving relief and
support to soul or body in its feebleness and suffering. If
he ever had any of such romantic and unpractical sensibility,
he has cast it off in his actual service in the fields of
benevolence, into which his profession has necessarily led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
him. He has learned over and over, the lesson of <em>active</em>
sympathy. He has learned it often under circumstances of
discouragement, and sometimes without even the show of
gratitude being offered to him. He has learned it, I am glad
to say, (and I say it with some tender recollections,) with
signs of gratitude in his patients, which are not to be mistaken—with
the blessing of those who were ready to perish,
but who were saved by his timely and persevering exertions.
He may appear to the casual observer to have
merged the feelings of the man in those of the physician—to
have surrendered his humanity to the cold and stern
demands of science. He may seem to be devoid of sympathy,
as he goes to work midst scenes of suffering, without
a tear, or even a sigh, performing his duties with an unblanched
face, a cool and collected air, and a steady hand,
while all around are full of fear, and trembling, and pity.
Yet there <em>is</em> sympathy in his bosom, but it is <em>active</em>. It
vents itself in the right way—in doing. There <em>is</em> feeling
there. It is not destroyed, but its manifestations are <em>under
control</em>. It is from this power of control which he has
acquired, that the physician or surgeon may appear to others
to be utterly without feeling, even when a tide of emotion
may be pressing his heart almost to bursting, because
he knows that a valuable life is hanging upon those very
exertions, which he is making with all the seeming coolness
of indifference.</p>

<p>I have said that the feeling of the physician vents itself
in action. Before that action begins, his emotions are often
oppressive, more so than those of the by-standers; for he
knows all the difficulties and dangers of the case, and sees
the very points which should excite anxiety. Watch him
while preparing for a serious operation. Though he may
appear to the careless observer perfectly cool and undisturbed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
you may see in his unguarded moments a betrayal
of the strong under-current of feeling, which he
endeavors to conceal. The occasional sigh, followed perhaps
by an incidental remark to a by-stander, as a diversion
to his feelings, just as the boy whistles to destroy his fear,
the compressed lips, the slightly trembling hand, as he busies
himself in making his preparations, thus finding relief to the
pressure of the excitement within by external acts, some
of them perhaps needless—these and other signs show it.
And these signs may appear up to the last moment of delay.
But the instant he begins the operation, they are gone.
The hand may tremble till the knife touches the flesh, and
the blood begins to gush; and then it is firm, for his feelings
have now found relief in <em>action</em>.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will be said that there is conclusive evidence,
that the tendency of the practice of medicine and surgery
is to harden and destroy feeling, in the fact itself, that, when
the physician comes to act, his natural sensibilities give
place to the mere excitement attending the different steps
of that action. In reply to this I say, that it is an error to
suppose, that because feeling is relieved for the moment by
diversion of the mind into another channel, it is of course
hardened, or destroyed. Feeling may and does resume its
hold when the action ceases; and, if the action ends in
relief, it manifests itself in a different form—in a joyful and
triumphant, in place of a sad and anxious sympathy. And
this change in the character of the sympathy has a tendency
to strengthen rather than lessen the natural sensibilities
of the heart. He who has year after year sympathized
with his patients in their sufferings, and then has rejoiced
with them in their deliverance—a deliverance of which he
has himself been instrumental—must be possessed both of a
more deep, and a more active sympathy, than when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
began his career of usefulness. This result is in consonance
with the laws of our nature. While the mere sight of suffering,
without any attempt to relieve it, often repeated,
manifestly blunts the sensibilities, and hardens the heart;
it is, on the other hand, the invariable effect of the effort to
remove the distresses of our fellow men, to make our sensibilities
more deep and more tender. Our interest in the
effort, our joy in its success, our lamentation over its failure,
the common cause which we make with the poor sufferer,
tend to produce this effect.</p>

<p>In this connection I will notice an error which is very
common. Persons who are not accustomed to look at
wounds, or witness scenes of sufferings, are apt when they
do so to have certain effects produced upon the physical
system, which are so well known, that I need not describe
them. The error consists in supposing them to be evidences
of feeling and sympathy, and the process of overcoming
them to be necessarily a hardening process. They
are effects produced in the nervous system, and have a
mere incidental, and not an essential connection with the
moral sensibilities. It is well known that all are not equally
susceptible of these effects, and the degree of susceptibility
is far from being an index of the degree of sympathy in
each individual. I have known many men, who had little
of true tenderness and kindness of feeling, faint away at
the sight of blood, while others with hearts overflowing with
tenderness, and a hand ever extended in active sympathy
to the needy and suffering, under the same circumstances
were entirely unaffected. The possession of this susceptibility
has therefore no necessary relation, to the moral
character. They who exhibit it are commonly spoken of
as being ‘tender-hearted,’ and yet there is nothing in this
quality which is inconsistent with the most wanton cruelty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
or the most abandoned vice. Neither has this susceptibility
any necessary relation to physical courage; much less to
moral courage. Many, who possess it to a great degree,
have nevertheless uncommon physical courage, so that
though they would turn pale at the sight of a cut finger,
they would face the cannon’s mouth without fear, and in
the excitement of battle, the flow of blood and the groans
of the wounded, would be unheeded. While on the contrary,
there are many, who are unaffected by the sight of
blood and suffering, in whom the idea of personal danger
would at once blanch the face and make the knees to tremble.</p>

<p>It is the conquest which the physician obtains over this
nervous susceptibility, of which I have been speaking, that
has given rise to the erroneous impression, that the practice
of medicine and surgery necessarily subjects the heart to a
hardening process. But you have seen, that while he is
acquiring this self-control, his sympathy with suffering is
becoming all the time deeper and livelier, by the exercise of
that active benevolence to which his profession calls him.
It is only the physician who refuses to yield to this call, and
pursues his profession as a mere trade for self-aggrandizement,
that blunts his sensibilities, and hardens his heart.</p>

<p>Sustaining then, as the physician does, so intimate a
relationship to his patients, and sympathizing so deeply, as
they feel that he does, with them in their trials, and sufferings,
and joys, his opportunities for influencing those around
him for good or for ill must be greater than fall to the lot
of most of those who occupy commanding stations in society.
He cannot avoid exerting a wide and an effectual
influence. It can be said emphatically of him, that every
act which he does, every word that he drops, is seed which
will surely produce fruit, and it is seed which he sows with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
a broad cast. The advice which he gives, the opinions
which he expresses, and the example which he sets, have
a double force from the fact, that the intimacy and sympathy
which exist between him and his patients unlock
the heart, and his influence finds no repulse in entering
there.</p>

<p>Every man has more influence in his own little community
at home by his own fireside, than he has abroad in the
great community around him. Familiarity, mutual confidence,
and sympathy, are the obvious causes of this. But
the physician may in a measure, as you have seen, be said
to be at home everywhere, by everybody’s fireside, in the
mansion and in the cottage, in the garnished chamber of the
wealthy, and in the humble and comfortless garret of the
poor. It is a matter of every day’s occurrence, that he
should be at home in all these varied scenes, and he acquires
a tact in accommodating himself to them, and to the endless
diversity of character which they present. Wherever
he goes he enters the family circle, as I have before said,
without that formality which attends the reception of other
visitors. He is received ordinarily without any preparation,
and at any hour when necessity calls for it. He sees
his patients, too, in every variety of situation, and in just
those circumstances which are calculated to develope and
exhibit character. He sees them in their unguarded moments,
and when sufferings and trials of every variety,
from the great calamity down to the most trivial disappointment,
are acting upon them as tests, searching and sure.
He sees much that glitters before the world become the
merest dross in the sick chamber; and he sees too the gold
shining bright in the crucible of affliction. He sees human
passion in every form and condition; implacable hatred
and love stronger than death; fallen virtue, and virtue tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
and proved; mental and moral strength inconceivable, and
childish imbecility in the once mighty and great; hope beaming
bright with heavenly lustre, and ghastly fear and black
despair; unbounded power of endurance, and the crushing
of the once buoyant spirit by even light calamities—every
feeling, or passion, or quality, or condition, that can be
imagined, in every possible variety of phase and degree, is
displayed to his view.</p>

<p>No one then has better and more various opportunities
for studying human character than the physician: and he
adds every day from this source to the storehouse of his
experience. I need not spend time to prove, that this
knowledge of character thus acquired confers upon him a
means of influence which he otherwise could not have. It
not only gives him a tact in influencing men generally; but
in individual cases, the revelations of thought and feeling
which he has witnessed at the fireside or in the sick room,
made in the free and unguarded moment, under the application
of faithful tests, afford him such an insight into the
character, that he knows just what chord to strike, to produce
the effect which he desires. He needs not to feel his
way to the heart. He has already learned it. He knows
just what motives will act with the most certainty, and
needs not to make any random experiments.</p>

<p>What responsibility then rests upon the physician! How
careful should he be in the expression of his opinions! At
what high ends should he aim in his daily example! How
important that he should be right upon the great moral questions
which agitate the community, and that his morality
should be strictly that of the Bible!</p>

<p>Too often is it the case, that the physician, who professes
to be governed by principle, exerts no such commanding
influence, as his relations to his fellow men enable him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
do; but, as a matter of policy, avoids committing himself
decidedly and openly upon those subjects which occasion
any diversity of opinion in the community. Those who
thus for selfish ends fail to meet the full responsibilities of
their station, do not, indeed, like the unprincipled, undertake
to please everybody (a contemptible course, and commonly
a profitless one) but they at least make it a main point to
displease no one. In so doing, it is true, they make no direct
attack upon principle, and inflict no positive injury upon
the moral interests of society; but they are guilty of a sacrifice
of principle, and they neglect to do the good which it
is in their power to do. Suffice it to say, that while the
physician should not court opposition by any needless
attacks upon the opinions and prejudices of others, for this
would impair his usefulness, a dignified and firm expression
of his sentiments, and a decided influence for good upon
every great moral question, we have a right to expect from
one who has so great a share, as the physician necessarily
has, in moulding the character of society.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the great moral question of Temperance,
which has for so many years agitated the community,
and upon which there has been so great a difference
of opinion. It is difficult to conceive that a physician,
possessed of the ordinary feelings of humanity, should fail
to be decided on this subject, either in his opinions, or his
influence. No man has had so varied and extensive opportunities
of witnessing the ravages of intemperance. It is
not an <em>occasional</em> visit that he has made to the miserable
home of the drunkard. It is not <em>occasionally</em> that he has
heard from trembling lips the tale of woe, and seen its painful
and often hideous signs. It has been with him an almost
every day occurrence. Misery on every hand has made
its appeal to him. And if he has allowed his desire for popularity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
to hinder him from heeding such touching and frequent
appeals, it is not too much to say to him, that he has
been shamefully recreant to the dictates of humanity, and
that he will have to render a large account of neglected
opportunities of doing good.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>No one has more frequent opportunities than the physician
for acting as a peace-maker, an office which is very
much needed, but which few are inclined to take. There
are always many, who are willing to act as peace-makers
in gross and palpable cases, when an actual quarrel has
burst out, and threatens a great and manifest damage to the
community, who yet may do nothing to repress the petty
jealousies and the slight contentions, which are generally
the cause of the greater commotions that heave up the very
foundations of society. But the true peace-maker is doing
his work at the fountain head, at the very beginnings of
strife—not only when urgent occasions call for it, but from
day to day, in every circle, by every fireside that he visits.
Every day he sees the risings of ill-feeling, envy, jealousy,
and discontent; and he calms them down by an influence
so gentle and charm-like, that it is scarcely observed. A
small thing, a word, a look, may often put out the spark
which is about to light the destructive train. How few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
there are in this world of jealousy and contention, who are
ready to utter that word, or bestow that look, and how many
who will fan the spark of strife into a blaze, or will at least
let it alone, and take no pains to put it out.</p>

<p>The physician in his intercourse with his patients has so
much of the free familiarity of home, that he can see these
sparks of contention, as they kindle up here and there,
more quickly than others can. Thought and feeling are
often revealed to him unconsciously, and the very fountains
from which they rise are almost open and naked to his
view, and, I may add, to his influence also. If he then be
a man of peace, he can do much from day to day in repressing
those thoughts and feelings, almost in their nascent
state, which, if encouraged, would distract and divide
family circles, neighborhoods, and perhaps communities.
If, on the other hand, he is not a peace-maker, but has an
ear ever open to the tongue of scandal, and is himself a
tattler—if he is ready to secure his own aggrandizement by
injuring his competitors, and is therefore disposed to rejoice
in the misfortunes of others, he scatters the seeds of contention
wherever he goes, and the peculiar relation which
he sustains to a large portion of the community enables
him so to scatter them, that they will be sure to take root,
and grow, and produce an abundance of fruit.</p>

<p>This leads me to say that it is especially true of the
physician, that the most of his influence lies in the little
hourly acts, and in the familiarly, perhaps carelessly, dropped
words, which make up the chief part of his life, and not so
much in the opinions which are formally expressed, or in
the acts which obviously follow deliberate consideration.
This is true to a great extent of every man who mingles in
society with the ordinary degree of freedom. They indeed,
who move about among their fellow-men with as little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
familiarity or sympathy as a recluse, have but little influence,
and that only when they utter their formal opinions. But
the occupation of a physician necessarily puts him at the
very antipodes with the recluse. Even if he be disposed to
shut up his heart against his fellow men, and to make his
intercourse with them of a strictly scientific character, his
bosom will very soon be unlocked, or he must give up his
profession. The fountains of sympathy and feeling will be
unsealed by the potent influence of daily intercourse with
human suffering and joy. He cannot from day to day
administer to the relief of distress without sympathy, and
that sympathy cannot always be suppressed. It will gush
forth, and the frigid man of science will become the kind
and familiar friend. Mingling then, as the physician necessarily
does, so freely and intimately with the world around
him, it must be eminently true of him, that it is the spirit of
the man, as it breathes forth in his common every day
words and acts, even in his very manner, that really gives
the character to his influence. So that if he be not forward
to speak out his sentiments, or to give his advice, the sentiments
which he has, and the advice which he would give,
are as well known, as if he uttered them. It is in truth
this aggregate influence (as it may be called) of his daily
life in the many homes to which his profession gives him
admittance, that imparts force to his advice, and opinions,
and acts.</p>

<p>I have as yet said nothing especially of the influence of
the physician in the <em>sick room</em>. Here he treads upon
sacred ground, and has to do with the issues of life and
death, both temporal and eternal. Here he sees man in
the weakness of his humanity, ‘crushed before the moth,’
but often, too, in the strength of his immortality. Here he
is made a witness of the frailty of the tenement, which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
immortal spirit inhabits—he sees that its ‘foundation is in
the dust.’ He has communion with the spirit in its most
momentous hours—while it sees the walls of its habitation
crumbling into dust, and lingers about the ruins before its
final flight into a world of light or darkness, of joy or of
woe—or perhaps, while with longing desire, and occasional
hope of its longer continuance here, it trembles with the
fear that it is about to be driven from its home in this
tabernacle, whose frailty is now staring it in the face—and
then too, there are times when he has converse with it as it
is becoming reinstated in the possession of its habitation by
gracious permission of its builder, who alone can repair it
and redeem it from destruction. Communion with the
spirit of man in such momentous seasons, how hallowed
should it be! Trifling, selfishness, disregard of principle,
how out of place are they here!</p>

<p>It is not my design to enter fully into a discussion of the
moral and religious duties, which devolve upon the physician
in the sick room. I choose rather to refer the reader
for instruction on these points to the excellent letters of Dr.
Burder, an English physician, which I have introduced in
the Appendix. I shall therefore only notice some of the
errors which are prevalent on this subject.</p>

<p>The great object of the physician should be to cure the
patient. This is his vocation, and nothing should be permitted
to interfere with it. And he must be on his guard,
lest he give up this object too readily. For often, very
often, especially in acute diseases, in cases which are apparently
hopeless, recovery does occur. The physician
therefore should avoid, even in desperate cases, producing
the impression upon the mind of the patient, that he really
believes the case to be hopeless. Nothing but the most
absolute certainty would warrant his doing this. The cordial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
influence of hope, as I have shown in the chapter on
the Influence of Hope in the Treatment of Disease, is often
one of the means by which a recovery is effected, and <em>the
absence of this one means may prove fatal</em>. Who then will
dare to take the responsibility of withholding this cordial,
often so essential a remedy, with the vain expectation (for
experience shows that it is commonly vain,) that in the
midst of all the turmoil and agitation of the fearful struggle
of life and death for the mastery, the spirit may be led to
make its peace with its God? And yet it is often claimed,
that the physician should under such circumstances declare
to the patient the certainty of his death; and if he decline
doing so, he is blamed for what is considered to be a palpable
neglect of duty.</p>

<p>Vain expectation, I say it is, which many indulge, of producing
repentance and reformation at such an hour. The
mind is weakened by the disease, thought and feeling and
sensation are all confused, the dim vision of the eye of
flesh is the faithful index of the dim vision of the mind, and
the poor soul, while it sees everything thus confusedly, is
tossed about upon the billows of conflicting passions and
hopes and fears. It is true that there is a power, which
can pluck it from the billows, and plant its feet upon the
rock of ages. It is an almighty power that cannot be
limited; but we have reason to think, that seldom is this
signal interposition put forth in this extremity. A true
philosophy declares, that this is no time for the clearness of
view, and definiteness of action, which religion demands of
man, and experience affirms the truth of the declaration.
Clergymen and physicians, who have had ample opportunities
of observation upon this point, have but little confidence
in any apparent change of character at the hour of
death. It is their universal testimony, that those who have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
made professions of repentance and reformation, when they
supposed themselves to be near dying, and yet have recovered,
have commonly given no evidence afterward that
those professions were well founded.</p>

<p>The above remarks have been made, it will be seen, in
regard to acute diseases only, and they apply to but a very
limited extent to cases of <em>chronic</em> disease. During the lingering
days, and weeks, and sometimes months, of such
cases, there are many opportunities for exerting an influence
upon the sick. And while it is true, that the physician
should adhere to the general rule, which I have stated in
regard to the effect of hope, it is his duty, and especially is
it the duty of the friends, to improve the opportunities
which present for the best good of the patient. And here
let me say, that it is not the formal and stately conversation,
the professional sermonizing, so often made use of,
which is really the most effectual; but it is the word
dropped from day to day, with a spirit not roused up for the
occasion, but breathing forth naturally and easily—it is the
instruction suggested by events of daily occurrence, or
by remarks which are dropped in common conversation,
and accompanied by the affectionate appeal, when it is
seen that the proper chord can be struck—this is the kind
of influence, which is brought to bear most decidedly upon
the moral and religious character of the sick man. It is
this that will enter his heart; while the arrows, which are
duly heralded by the note of preparation, will fall to the
ground, warded off by the shields which he raises against
them.</p>

<p>Injudicious attempts are sometimes made to influence
the sick, both with regard to their temporal, and their eternal
interests. I will cite but a single case in illustration.
It is a case which was reported by the late Dr. Hale of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
Boston, in his work on Spotted Fever. Although the
patient was so sick, that Dr. H. considered it of the utmost
importance that he should be kept quiet, and gave the most
positive and authoritative injunctions to this effect, yet a
friend, to whom the proper adjustment of the sick man’s
affairs, if his sickness was to end in death, was a matter of
considerable interest, persisted in harrassing him on this
subject. The result was an alarming increase of the
disease. The symptoms were afterward, however, so
much mitigated, as to give some ground for hope of a
recovery. As his mind was clear and rational when he
came out of his stupor, “his attendant with a very benevolent
but mistaken zeal, thought it more important to improve
this opportunity in taking care of his soul’s health,
than in administering the remedies which had been prescribed;
and, instead of giving the medicines with care and
attention, and promoting his rest and quietness, as he ought
to have done, and had been strictly enjoined to do, he spent
the whole time in talking, and exciting him to talk, of his
hopes and prospects beyond the grave.” This conversation
was continued for about two hours, and then the
patient sank back into a stupor, a state of collapse which
was caused by the previous excitement, and he never
awoke. If the quietness enjoined by the physician had
been maintained, this case would probably have resulted in
recovery.</p>

<p>There are some cases, in which it is clear even to the
careless observer, that it is wrong to excite the mind of
the patient on any subject. Take, for example, a case of
typhus fever. Even though it may not be a severe case,
the mental with the physical sensibilities are so blunted and
deranged, that no moral or religious influence can do any
good. If it rouse the patient’s torpid mind to action, it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
only do harm by the disturbance it creates; and if it produces
a mild, quiet effect, which may be gratifying to his
friends, it is worthy of no confidence, and when he recovers
he may have no recollection of the sayings which he uttered,
and which would have been garnered and kept, as a sacred
treasure, by friendship and love, if death had transported
him to another world.</p>

<p>In such a case as this, when the mind is in so passive
and torpid a condition, the path of duty is clear. But
there are some cases in which it is difficult to know what
our duty is. We must then decide as well as we can in
view of all the circumstances. And let me remark here, that
there should be no inconsiderate and irresponsible action at
such times; but what is done should be the result of a candid
conference between the physician and the friends of the
patient. The clergyman should not be disposed to act
independently, and from his own judgment alone; but, for
obvious reasons, he should consult with the physician in
regard to each individual case.</p>

<p>Some are very anxious in regard to the spiritual welfare
of the sick, when they are thought to be nigh unto death;
but if death does not ensue, the moment that convalescence
begins their anxiety ceases. Religion with them is altogether
a thing for great occasions, and the season of death
is of course one of them. Anything which is exciting
arouses them to action, and awakens their sympathies for
their fellow men. But they make little account of the
every day influence which is exerted in their common
intercourse—an influence vast in amount in a long life,
though it may not be palpable in its results at any one moment.
While they would press upon the sick man the
solemn and faithful appeal, when they saw him to be near
the borders of the grave, and concentrate upon that dread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
hour all their energies, they would perhaps, if he should
recover, not even visit him at all during his convalescence,
and the first time they met him they would welcome him
back to that worldliness, in which they in common with
him so freely indulge.</p>

<p>And yet it is in convalescence generally that you can
exert the greatest influence upon the sick man. For look
at the circumstances of the case. He has just been released
from suffering. The recollection of those hours, when
thought and feeling and sensation were so confused, and all
was dark and dim, is still vivid in his mind. The world,
from which he has been thoroughly secluded for a little
time, now opens fresh upon him again—a new sun shines
upon him, and he looks out upon a new earth. The pure
air, as he remembers the stifled breath and the languor of
disease, has an invigorating buoyancy that it never had
before; and he now for the first time knows the luxury of
such common blessings as breathing, and again and again
he expands the chest to the full, to see how beautifully it
does its work. He feels the genial glow of returning
health pervading every part of his system, diffusing elasticity,
energy, I had almost said joy, everywhere. And
then as he goes forth, he meets on all sides the kind greetings
of friends, some of whom had been by his bedside
during his sickness. All these circumstances conspire to
make both the sensations of his body and the feelings of his
heart agreeable, and thus open the avenues to moral and
religious influences. And then, too, the cares and selfishness
of the world have not yet resumed their control over
him. When, I ask, could there be a better time to awaken
in that man’s heart proper feelings towards his Maker, and
toward all around him. As he comes out afresh into life,
with something of the simplicity of a child, disencumbered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
by his sickness of the entanglements which had gathered
around his mind and heart in the midst of temptation and
sin, how easily can he be led to appreciate what is right,
and good, and enduring, in this evil and transitory world.
His mind is not now weakened, nor his sensibilities blunted
or deranged by disease. There is no dim vision now, but
he sees things as they are, and his sensibilities are lively
and ready to respond to the touch of the hand of friendship,
like the chords of a newly-attuned instrument that gives
forth its clear and harmonious sounds to delight the ear.</p>

<p>I cannot dismiss the subject of the moral influence of physicians
without adverting to one topic, which I deem to be of
no small importance.</p>

<p>Every man, aside from the influence which he exerts as
a citizen in common with others, exerts also an influence
through the business or profession in which he is engaged, by
the manner in which he performs its duties and maintains
its relations. There is a strong disposition in the community
to separate these influences, and to assign to them for
their governance two different sets of moral principles.
This disposition is very marked in regard to politics. But
it exists also in relation to other professions and employments.
It has even extended to medicine. Men often do
as <em>physicians</em> what they would be ashamed to do as <em>men</em>.
The strict morality of common intercourse is relaxed in
professional intercourse. But the man and the physician
cannot thus be separated. Obedience to principle, no
matter in what it appears, always has its good influence;
and the same universality attaches to the bad influence of
disregard of principle. There is a moral character belonging
to every act. Strictly professional acts and relations
have a moral influence. If the physician has a proper
regard for the character and standing of his profession, promotes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
an honorable intercourse among its members, upholds
its organizations, resists the encroachments of
quackery, and helps to secure a good standard of medical
education, he in all these ways exerts an indirect but important
influence upon the general good order and well-being
of society. But if, on the other hand, he has no true
regard for the honor of his profession, sacrifices its interests
to his own aggrandizement, labors for success by intrigue
and manœuvre, and thus gives a license to quackery,
though he may call himself a strictly moral man, and be so
esteemed by the public, he exerts by his professional course
a decidedly bad influence upon the general tone of morality
in the community, and therefore does not merit the appellation
of a good citizen.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.<br>
<span class="fs80">TRIALS AND PLEASURES OF A MEDICAL LIFE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The physician has his peculiar trials, and also his peculiar
enjoyments. The principal of these it is my intention
to notice very briefly and cursorily in this closing chapter.</p>

<p>Let us first look at the <em>trials</em> of a medical life.</p>

<p>The physician is subjected to great fatigue both of body
and mind. He has no time that he can call his own. That
regularity of life, which is so essential to comfort as well as
to health, he must in a great measure abandon, especially if
he practice in a scattered population. While most men
have their stated seasons of repose, he is liable to be called
for at any hour, and often night after night sleep is a
stranger to his eyelids. His duties to his patients are often
of such immediate importance, that no stress of weather,
however violent, is considered as an excuse for delay.
When prevailing disease spreads terror through the community
he must be at his post, and expose himself to the pestilence
under the influence of powerful predisposing causes—anxiety
and fatigue. And then there are at all times anxieties
and perplexities, producing a wear and tear of mind,
which is worse than all the bodily fatigue that he is called
to endure. It is not surprising then, that it has been satisfactorily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
ascertained by statistics, that physicians constitute
one of the short-lived classes of the community.</p>

<p>And for all this generally the medical man gets comparatively
a small compensation. Though some physicians
acquire wealth, especially in our large cities, still as a body
of men they are in moderate circumstances, and the practice
of medicine may be truly said to be far from being a
money-making business. A large proportion of those
whom they serve are too poor to give them any compensation,
and very many of those who are able to pay them do
not without reluctance and delay. This, it is true, is in
part to be attributed to the remissness of physicians in presenting
their claims. But why this remissness? If I mistake
not, it arises from the unwillingness to pay, which they
so often meet with, even in quarters where they have no
reason to expect it. The consequent dislike to the business
of collecting begets a habit of neglecting it. A large
proportion of their patients feel a less urgent obligation to
pay them, than they do to pay others. I know not any
other reason for this than the <em>intangibility</em> of the favor
which is bestowed by the physician. If a man buy a coat
of the tailor, or a barrel of flour of the grocer, he has a <em>tangible</em>
memento of his obligation; for the coat is seen, and is
felt upon his back, and the flour is eaten, and makes its
<em>sensible</em> impression on the palate and stomach. But health
restored is a thing of air, and the visits of the physician, as
they have left no memorial behind them that addresses the
<em>senses</em>, are easily forgotten. For the same reason a man
will not so easily forget his obligations to his physician if he
has amputated a limb for him, as he would if he had attended
him through a course of fever. His crutch or his wooden
leg, is ever present to remind him of them. And for the
same reason also, as the tailor and grocer can get their pay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
more readily before the coat is worn out, and the flour is
eaten up, than they could a long time afterward, so the physician
is more cheerfully paid immediately after returning
health, than he can be at any future period.</p>

<p>While the physician is ordinarily but poorly compensated
for all his toil and anxiety, he is obliged often to see the
quack and hobby-rider amassing wealth by their gross impostures.
Often does the scientific and laborious practitioner,
who is adding from his daily observations rich treasures
to the recorded experience of the profession, suffer
from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">res angusta domi</i>, while he sees some proprietor of
a patent medicine, the recipe for which he purchased of
some recreant physician, or filched from some medical book,
acquiring a fortune almost in a day, or some ignorant pretender,
adopting some system just then high in the popular
favor, as Homœopathy for example, making in a brief year
or two all the display of a wealthy citizen. And the offensiveness
of such cases is enhanced by the fact, that many
of the well-informed and the learned unite with the multitude
in casting contempt upon the labors of science, by
upholding the pretensions and filling the coffers of sheer
imposture.</p>

<p>The facility, with which the public are imposed upon in
regard to medicine, is a prolific source of vexation and
trial to the scientific and high-minded physician. He is
subjected to a constant encounter with false opinions, unfounded
prejudices, unreasonable caprices, and gross misapprehensions.
He hears ignorance in high places, as well as
in low, putting forth its oracular opinions, as it sits in judgment
upon his practice, and that of his brethren. The
most reckless criticisms are made upon his mode of treatment
in individual cases, and the most inconsiderate and
wanton aspersions are cast upon his professional character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span></p>

<p>If the practice of imposition were confined to those who
are without the pale of the profession, it would be a trial
which could be borne with comparative ease. But when
the physician sees his own brethren stooping to an occasional
use of the arts of the charlatan, and obtaining success
thereby, even among the better portion of the community,
while they do it so covertly that they do not lose caste
with the profession, it is a sore trial to his spirit. He cannot
but regard such men as the chief enemies of the honor
of his profession, though they may talk loudly of their
attachment to it, and as real opposers of the advancement
of medical science, though they may make a great show of
zeal in its pursuit. And yet so adroitly do they manœuvre,
that they generally escape exposure. This sly quackery,
which is practised by so many medical men, provoking an
indignation, to which it will do no good to give utterance,
is one of the prominent trials of the truly honorable physician.</p>

<p>It is a severe trial to the feelings of the humane physician
to see valuable lives sacrificed to a blind trust in ignorance
and unskilfulness. He is occasionally obliged to witness
such a sacrifice, and ordinarily under such circumstances
that any interference on his part would do no good, however
strangely he may be urged to it by the dictates of humanity.
If he utter the warning voice, however clear the case
may be, it will be ascribed to interested and unworthy motives.
He may feel deeply for the poor sufferer who is to
be sacrificed, and for the family who are to be thus bereaved
by the ruthless hand of unskilful ignorance; but hard as it
is to hold his peace, he in most cases feels that he must do
it, because if he do otherwise, he will not only spend his
breath in vain, but will add to the evil by his ineffectual
opposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span></p>

<p>The many sad scenes in which the physician is obliged
to mingle must often make him sorrowful, if he has not suffered
his feelings and sympathies to be destroyed by a total
dereliction of principle. As he watches with earnestness
the struggle which occurs in severe cases between life and
death for the mastery, and does what he can to give it a
favorable issue, how deep is his anxiety, how painful the
sense of his responsibility, what balancings of hope and fear
does he experience; and then when the dread moment comes,
when after all this pressure and conflict of feeling, the physician
becomes persuaded that the issue is certain to be
fatal, how is his spirit borne down with the burden of his
grief! And then, too, there are cases, in which, though he
has from the first had strong hopes of a favorable termination,
all at once a train of symptoms arises, threatening
immediate destruction. And to add to the painfulness of
the case, perhaps the friends of the patient have not perceived
the change, so secret has it been. As he goes to
make his usual daily visit, cheered with the expectation of
finding his patient better, he is overwhelmed with surprise
when he sees, as he enters the sick chamber, that death is
rapidly and surely doing its work. Besides seeing his own
hope extinguished in a moment, he feels an unutterable pang
in the necessity, thus suddenly pressing upon him, of destroying
the hopes of the fond friends by whom the patient
is surrounded.</p>

<p>In the Chapter on the Moral Influence of Physicians, I
have spoken of the intimate relation, in which the physician
stands to so many families, and of the strength and tenderness
which his attachment to them acquires, by the exercise
of an active sympathy during a long series of years. The
accumulation of sympathy which thus occurs deepens the
sorrow which he feels, as he sees in the case of some member<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
of a family, upon which he has long attended, that his
efforts are unavailing, and that the resources of his art are
all exhausted. And as the friends gather round the bed of
death, though by a habit of self-control he has an air of
composure which is generally attributed to want of feeling
he makes one of that circle, entering into their griefs as the
sympathizing friend, as well as the faithful physician. And
the very confidence which is reposed in him, gratifying as
it is, sometimes adds poignancy to his grief. ‘You saved
<em>my</em> life, and why cant you save my husband?’—said a woman
to me in the extremity of her agony, when I told her that
it was not possible for her husband to recover.</p>

<p>Another circumstance which adds to the sorrow of the
physician in such seasons, especially when long acquaintance
has created a strong personal attachment, is the total
want of preparation with which many come to the hour of
death. Even if the physician be not a religious man, this
consideration must press upon him at times with a painful
interest, if he has the common feelings of humanity. Especially
will this be the case, when he is obliged to witness
some of those horrible scenes, which sometimes occur in
the last hours of a career of vice.</p>

<p>The sorrowful scenes, which the physician witnesses occasionally
in the ordinary routine of his business, come
with a painful frequency, when some fatal epidemic is prevalent
in the community. Then night and day his mind
is filled with anxiety. The sorrows of bereavement continually
call for his sympathy. And in the midst of all this,
he avoids solicitude for his own safety, only by forgetting
himself in the arduous duties which he performs for others’
welfare. While he sees others fleeing from the pestilence,
he must be ever at his post. Though he may see some of
his brethren falling around him, humanity demands of him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
that he should go on in his services to the sick, and to the
honor of our profession I believe it may be said, that this
demand is very seldom disregarded. During the prevalence
of the yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1793, of the thirty-five
physicians who remained in the city, eight (nearly one
fourth of the whole number, died, and but three escaped an
attack of the disease).</p>

<p>One of the greatest trials which the physician has to bear
is the ingratitude of those upon whom he has conferred
favors. There are services rendered by the medical man
who is faithful to his high trust, for which no money is an
adequate compensation. His reward for such services
comes from two sources—the satisfaction always attending
the performance of duty, and the gratitude of those to whom
they are rendered. The wealthy by no means discharge in
full their obligations to the physician, who attends upon
them in all their sickness with unwearied fidelity, when they
pay him in full for his attendance. They owe to him the
affection of a true friendship, and the gratitude due to something
more than a professional performance of duty in their
behalf. The relation of a physician to his employers is not
shut up within the narrow limits of mere pecuniary considerations.
There is a sacredness in it, which should forbid
its being subjected to the changes incident to the common
relations of trade and commerce among men. But many
do not so regard it. They dismiss a physician for as slight
a reason as governs them in ceasing to buy of one man,
and giving their patronage to another, or, as Dr. Rush says,
“with as little feeling as they dismiss a servant, or dispose
of a family horse.” A mere whim, or caprice, is often
suffered to dissolve this relation, though it may have existed
for years. And generally the more frivolous and unfounded
the reason for the change, the greater will be the zeal with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
which they laud their new favorite, and the harsher will be
the aspersions, which they will cast upon the professional
character of the old and tried friend, whom they have
deserted.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, it is the experience of every
physician, that some of the strongest evidences of ingratitude
come from some of those upon whom he has conferred
the highest favors, perhaps those which are entirely gratuitous.
One would suppose that they who have had the
services of a physician without making him any compensation,
would from motives of delicacy refrain from speaking
ill of him, if they chose to discharge him and employ
another. But blame is sometimes dealt out without stint
under such circumstances. It would be supposed also
that the obligation, which a gratuitous attendance imposes,
would always be gratefully recognized by the patient. But
it is often otherwise. Many patients are disposed to forget
such obligations; and everything which may call them up
to their attention, and especially to the attention of others,
is carefully avoided. Dr. Rush speaks of some who had
been attended gratuitously in humble life, who deserted
their family physician after their elevation to rank and consequence
in society, “lest they should be reminded, by an
intercourse with him, of their former obscure and dependent
situation.”</p>

<p>There is not as much gratitude in the world as is commonly
supposed. This is particularly true of the services
of a physician. These are received by many, as a matter
of course, as being something to which they have a sort of
natural right. They seem to class them among the common
blessings, such as air and water, for which, because
they are so common, they have no idea of being grateful.
Day after day, and week after week, they may be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
objects of the physician’s most assiduous attentions, and his
exertions may be blessed, and obviously so, to the preservation
of life; but when health comes they will grudge him
even the pittance of a half day’s labor from those hands to
which his skill has restored strength, though they spend
days and weeks every year in the most shiftless idleness.
Quite a large proportion of the poor treat the physician in
this way.</p>

<p>An old physician of my acquaintance was used to say
that there are three kinds of poor—the Lord’s poor, the
devil’s poor, and poor devils; that is, the virtuous poor, the
vicious poor, and those who are poor from sheer shiftlessness.
The <em>virtuous</em> poor are always grateful; and there
are none among the wealthy upon whom the physician
attends more cheerfully, than he does upon some of this
class. Of his kind offices to them, and of their feelings
in return to him, it can be said in the beautiful language of
Scripture, ‘When the ear heard me, then it blessed me;
and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me: because
I delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless, and him
that had none to help him. The blessing of him that was
ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the widow’s
heart to sing for joy.’ As the physician goes his daily
rounds, there is no one thing that so cheers him on in his
course of toil and benevolence, as the gratitude of the
virtuous poor. And if there will be tears shed at his death
beyond the little circle of friends, in the very bosom of
which he lives, <em>they</em> will shed them profusely and long.</p>

<p>Not so, however, with the other two classes of the poor.
The shiftless poor, who were denominated by my aged
friend ‘poor devils,’ who go just as wind and tide will take
them, and carry to ultraism the principle of letting to-morrow
take care of itself, are actually too lazy to have so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
lively a feeling as gratitude. And of the <em>vicious</em> poor it
may be said, that it requires something more than the selfish
principles of this world to attend upon them with
cheerful faithfulness. There is often, it is true, much show
of gratitude; but it is seldom, though it is sometimes, more
than mere show. The romance of doing good will not
stand this trial. Nothing short of the untiring benevolence
of Christianity will do it. Sometimes, indeed, so much
effect is produced upon the views and feelings of the poor
by the bounty and kind attentions of the benevolent, that
an actual reform is effected, and an abode of vice and
misery is converted into one of virtue and happiness.
Then, of course, the most lively gratitude is manifested.
But it is rarely so. We must apparently <em>throw away</em> much
time and effort, and it is only once in a great while that
our hearts can be cheered by any obvious good results, or
any real gratitude. Benevolence does now and then seem
to have a magic wand, with which, almost in a twinkling,
she turns scenes of gloom and desolation into those of
beauty, and makes even the wilderness to blossom as the
rose. But she is generally employed in real drudgery with
little immediate prospect of success. She digs and digs
patiently, and with the animation of hope. She finds but
few gems; but these, be it remembered, will survive all the
changes of time, and will shine in her coronet forever.</p>

<p>It is true that gratitude is sometimes awakened in the
heart of the vicious poor, even when our influence does
not produce any improvement in their moral condition.
But it has only a momentary existence, and, amid the
giddy whirl of grovelling enjoyments, our kindness is forgotten,
and the recollection of it is excited only by their
returning necessities. And then too, the apathy, into
which the heart is apt to be schooled by the miserable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
monotony of a vicious poverty, effaces every trace of feeling
which may occasionally be impressed upon it. This
state of heart may be read in the very countenance—the
wooden features, which our kindness may have roused to
some degree of animation, soon resume their wonted inexpressive
fixedness after the exciting cause is gone. And
often, very often, the favors we dispense are received with
a vacant stare, the recipients being strangers themselves to
any other motive than selfishness, and therefore taking no
cognizance of the existence of anything like benevolence
in the bosoms of others.</p>

<p>There is one class of the community that have been
accustomed to be attended gratuitously by physicians, who
have so often wounded the feelings of our profession by
the course which they have pursued, that I cannot pass
them by without a particular notice. I refer to clergymen.
So scantily are they generally compensated for their
services, and so intimate is the relation which they hold to
our profession, that medical men have commonly very
cheerfully made their attendance upon them gratuitous.
This being the case, they have a right to expect of them, if
not gratitude, at least a proper regard for their rights as
professional men. But I am constrained to say that many
of this class have failed to answer this reasonable expectation.
The physician often finds, that the clergyman, upon
whose family he has attended without charge, perhaps for a
long time, gives his certificate in recommendation of some
nostrum, or employs some quack, or becomes the noisy
advocate of some new system just now rising into popular
favor, or perhaps, in his zeal for his sect, becomes the active
patron of some practitioner of his own denomination, urging
him even upon the families of the physician whose services
he has so long gratuitously enjoyed. Such acts as these on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
the part of men who have received such favors, and who
by their station and character can exert so much influence,
are among the most vexatious trials of a medical life.</p>

<p>The feelings of the physician are tried not only by the
treatment of individuals, but by that general disposition
against the medical profession, which is to some extent
manifest in every community. If you look candidly upon
the public benefits<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> which our profession has conferred upon
society, to say nothing of its toils and self-denials, you will
be impressed with the fact, that it does not receive that
respect and that regard for its interests to which it is fairly
entitled. The radicalism which aims to overthrow it is in
some measure countenanced by many, of whom we have a
right to expect better things. Many of the intelligent and
well informed pay an occasional tribute to empiricism, and
manifest a distrust towards medicine, which they do not
manifest towards any other science. Though they would
be sure to employ none but lawyers of known skill, and
would sit under the teachings of none but well educated
clergymen; if sickness comes, they resort to some secret
nostrum, or employ some pretender, of whom perhaps they
know little else, than that he calls himself a German, and
has an abundance of hair about his visage; and if they
have a dislocated or fractured bone, they abjure scientific
surgery as unworthy of confidence, and send for a natural
bone-setter. The reasons which secure their respect for
other sciences fail altogether when they come to medicine.
They even indulge in a playful contempt in speaking of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
claims. They banish it from the pale of reason; and submit
themselves to vagaries and fallacies and pretensions,
the folly of which they would see at once in relation to any
other subject. They refuse to give to either the science,
or the profession, that steady esteem which is clearly due
to it from all stable and intelligent men. In seasons of
trial even, instead of extending to physicians their confidence
and support, they reward their toils with an ungenerous
and inconsiderate fault-finding. This ingratitude of
the public is sometimes manifested in the most offensive
manner. After the yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1798 had
subsided, at a meeting of the citizens, in which the committee
who superintended the city during the prevalence of the
disease was honored with a vote of thanks, a similar vote
was proposed in relation to the physicians, <em>but was not even
seconded</em>, though, as I have stated in another place, nearly
one fourth of their number perished, in their efforts to save
that ungrateful people from the ravages of the pestilence.</p>

<p>Let us turn now to the consideration of the <em>pleasures</em> of
a medical life. On this branch of the subject I shall be
brief, not because the physician has few joys, for he has
many, but because they require no extended notice to make
the reader appreciate them.</p>

<p>If we look at medicine simply as a science it is full of
interest, and the study of it is therefore a rich source of
gratification. Its subjects have a wide range and an endless
variety. No science has such extensive and intimate
connections with other sciences.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> It gathers to itself the
resources of chemistry, botany, mechanics, comparative
anatomy and physiology, and mental philosophy; and fills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
its storehouse of facts with a variety and abundance sufficient
to satisfy the wildest and most eager curiosity. The
phenomena of life even in the healthy condition are exceedingly
diversified; but, as modified by disease, and by the
remedies which are administered, their variations are never
ending. And then the mysterious connection of mind and
body not only varies them still more, but opens to us a mass
of facts of a mingled mental and physical character, which
awaken an intense interest. The physician looks upon the
human body, not merely as a machine filled with contrivances
so cunning and elaborate, as to render all the mechanism
of man in the comparison rude and bungling; but
as a machine instinct with life, having a living nerve
attached to every fibre of it, giving to it its power to act;
and, more than all, as a machine holding in strange connection
with its every fibre a reasoning soul, the image of
the Deity, destined, not to perish like the mind of the brute
with the perishing body, but to live through the ages of
eternity.</p>

<p>The details of a science which treats of phenomena so
interesting in their character, and so wide in their range,
are never dry and uninteresting, as the details of other
sciences sometimes are. There are no tedious technicalities,
no dull abstractions. There is no tiresome monotony.
There is therefore an absorbing enthusiasm in the pursuit
of medical science, which is not so common in other studies.
It is an enthusiasm which makes its votary disregard the
loathsomeness of putrefaction, and even forget danger, in
his search after truth.</p>

<p>An additional interest is given to his investigations by
the consideration, that if he discover a fact, or help to establish
one, he adds to the resources which our art can apply
to the relief of human misery. To experience this pleasure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
so gratifying to the humane and benevolent mind, he needs
not to make any grand discovery. The joy which Jenner
realized in the contemplation of the benefits of his discovery
must have been almost overpowering; but the benefit
which results to our race from the humblest contribution to
medical knowledge is as real though not as great, and is a
fitting subject for joy to him who makes it, for it will assuage
many a pang and save many a life.</p>

<p>In the practice of medicine, though there is, as you have
seen in my first chapter, much uncertainty, there is a high
satisfaction in the very exercise of unravelling its perplexities,
and in separating, as it can be done by untiring and
careful observation, the certain from the uncertain, the true
from the false. And though much is left to nature by the
judicious physician, still there is much pleasure in watching
her movements, in removing obstacles which oppose her
salutary processes, and in assisting her efforts so far as it
may be necessary to do so. This intelligent watch and
guidance which medical skill exercises over nature in
removing disease is far from being unsatisfactory to the
rational practitioner. And then, too, though the general use
of <em>heroic</em> remedies is injurious, there are times when the
careful observer sees opportunities for employing them to
great advantage in arresting morbid processes. And so
accustomed is he to make the requisite discriminations, that
his efforts in positive medication are well directed, and are
almost sure to accomplish their object. He has a satisfaction
in such achievements, of which the undiscriminating
overdoser knows nothing.</p>

<p>The judicious physician experiences much gratification
in the <em>mental</em> management of the sick. I refer not merely
to the control which by his tact and skill he exercises over
the mind which is manifestly deranged, but also to those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
multiplied and various mental influences which he exerts so
silently, but so effectually, even in ordinary cases of sickness.
Besides the pleasurable interest with which he
watches the operation of these influences, there is also a
high source of gratification in the consciousness of possessing
such a power over the minds of his fellow men. Especially
is this the case, when the power which he puts forth
is exerted upon minds of great refinement, and of a high
order of talent.</p>

<p>The <em>results</em> of the practice of the skilful and judicious
physician are as a whole very gratifying to him. His vocation
is to relieve pain and distress, and to deliver from
disease; and when he fails to do this, sad as it is, it is an
occasional, we may say a <em>rare</em> exception to the general
result. In the great majority of even severe cases, in which
the pressure of responsibility is such a burden upon his
spirit, and the alternations between hope and fear are often
so painfully exciting, his heart is at length gladdened by a
favorable issue. The physician is therefore by habit a
hopeful, a cheerful, a happy man. As such he enters the
sick room, the scene of the triumphs of his art. As such
he mingles in the family and social circles of his fellow
men, inspiring by his very air and manner cheerfulness in
the sad, and hope in the unfortunate and dispirited. The
physician then is apt to be not only the sympathising, but
the <em>comforting</em> friend.</p>

<p>But not only is the success with which he meets in combatting
disease a source of happiness to the physician, but
so also especially is the gratification of his humanity and
benevolence, in relieving the distresses of his fellow men,
and in prolonging their lives. In some cases in which the
life which he has struggled to save is a valuable one, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>
joy which fills his heart at the final successful issue of that
struggle no words can express.</p>

<p>It will be observed by the reader that in speaking of the
gratification which is derived from the successful treatment
of disease, I have had no reference at all to the <em>reputation</em>
for success which is awarded to medical men by the community.
This may be based upon real merit, or it may not
be. When it is not, but is acquired by making false issues
before the public, as is too often the case, it is indeed a
source of gratification—a gratification, however, which is
not only of a low order, but the hold which the possessor
has upon it is exceedingly uncertain. He feels it to be so,
and is in constant fear that some competitor, practising the
same arts, will overmatch him in skill, and filch from him
his ill-gotten joys. But on the other hand, the success of
the honorable practitioner in acquiring a medical reputation,
based as it is upon intelligent grounds, is a source of high
gratification, and he has, too, the satisfaction of feeling that
it is a permanent possession. True, there are some who
employ and praise him from whim and caprice, who from
whim and caprice may desert and blame him; but his
patients are for the most part those who repose in him an
intelligent and firm confidence. And this affords him a
gratification, of which the caprices of the world and the
intrigues of his brethren cannot despoil him.</p>

<p>The attachments which the physician forms in so many
families in the different walks of life are rich sources of happiness.
These attachments are generally reciprocal. In
some cases the interest which he feels in the patient, beginning
in infancy, and extending through many scenes of
sickness up to adult age, has accumulated all this time more
and more strength and tenderness. Sometimes in the long
life of a physician, this interest in some families of patients<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
reaches through three or even four generations. And
these intimate attachments bring the physician into very
near relation with some characters of rare excellence in
the different walks of life. The admiration and the love
with which he looks upon such noble spirits, of whom the
world is not worthy, and the communion which he is permitted
to have with them up to the moment of their departure
to a world of bliss, are among the highest sources of
the happiness of the physician.</p>

<p>The opportunity which the physician has for observing
human character is a prolific source of enjoyment. It
opens to him one of the most interesting of all studies, and
in his daily intercourse with patients of every variety and
degree, he finds no lack of material in illustration of any
supposable variation of character.</p>

<p>The nature of the physician’s employment, it must be
obvious to the reader, is calculated to fit him eminently to
enjoy and to adorn social life. He is commonly the pleasing
companion as well as the warm and faithful friend.
The freedom of his intercourse with all sorts and conditions
of men imparts an ease and a zest to his conversation, and
he has an abundance of facts and anecdotes to illustrate
every remark which may be made. It is for this reason, as
Dr. Rush says, that “physicians in all countries have been
the most welcome guests at the tables of the great, and are
frequently waited for with the most impatience at clubs and
in convivial companies.”</p>

<p>One of the chief sources of the happiness of the physician
is the gratitude of his patients. I have already said enough
upon this subject, and I would now simply remark, that,
though there is much ingratitude which is a sore trial to
him, many of his patients gladden him in the midst of his
toils and anxieties with tokens of gratitude of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
delightful character. And among these tokens, the testimonials
which he receives from the poor, humble as they
are, are often more highly prized than the costly and
splendid presents of the wealthy.</p>

<p>Finally, a great source of happiness is afforded to the
truly benevolent physician in the opportunity which he has
for exerting a good moral influence. When by his instrumentality
the abode of vice and misery has been converted
into one of virtue and peace, and especially when his
counsel and influence have been the means of saving a soul
from death, he has a higher joy than all success however
brilliant, and honor however profusely awarded, and gratitude
however ardent, can impart to his soul.</p>

<p>In conclusion I remark, that, though the trials and disappointments
and mortifications of a medical life are numerous,
very vexatious, and sometimes almost insupportable,
yet the pleasures which come from the sources to
which I have alluded vastly predominate over them all, and
make the practice of medicine, when pursued with right
motives, as a noble profession, and not as a trade, to be in
the main eminently satisfactory and delightful.</p>

<h3>LETTER I.</h3>

<p class="center no-indent fs80">ON THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE UNDERTAKING.</p>

<p class="no-indent">
<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>You were pleased to desire me to send you the result of
my observation and experience on the deeply interesting subject
of endeavoring to promote the spiritual welfare of the sick
committed to your care. I cheerfully accede to your wish,
although I can scarcely hope to offer any suggestions which
have not already occurred to your own reflective mind.</p>

<p>If the soul of man be immortal, and if the state of the soul, at
the moment of its separation from the body, determine its happiness
or misery through endless ages, with what deep solicitude
should every Christian approach the bed of a fellow
creature, who, to all appearance, is about to undergo the
momentous change, yet unprepared “to meet his God!” If
we saw a human being proceeding blindfold towards a tremendous
precipice, even already at its brink, how eagerly should we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
try to snatch him from the threatening destruction! And can
we, my friend, remain insensible to the spiritual danger of the
dying man, who seems about to “take a leap in the dark” into
the gulf of inconceivable—irretrievable ruin? How often,
alas! are we called to witness the appalling scene, unalleviated
by the presence of a Christian minister, or any pious relative,
who might direct the helpless sufferer to Him, “who is able to
save to the uttermost!”</p>

<p>I am aware, indeed, that those alone who, like ourselves,
have felt the weight of medical responsibility, can fully estimate
the difficulties to be encountered in attempting to advance the
<em>highest</em> interest of a patient, while conscientiously discharging
our primary duty, in the exertion of our utmost efforts for the
restoration or relief of his bodily frame. Even to those, who,
by habits of early rising, punctuality, systematic arrangement,
and calm despatch, have been able to allot a sufficient portion of
time to each appointment of the day,—how often does it happen
that some unexpected emergency, some sudden complication
of disease, the alarming sickness of another member of the
family, some anxious inquiries of the patient or his friends, or
other unforeseen circumstances, have more than consumed the
allotted time, and in justice to the indispensable claims of other
cases, rendered an immediate departure necessary: thus affording
no opportunity of even alluding to “things unseen and
eternal.”</p>

<p>Another difficulty is often found to arise, from the almost
exclusive occupation of the physician’s mind by the diseased
condition of the sufferer, the relief of which is, of course, our
primary and incumbent duty. In order to give to each symptom,
as well as to the whole assemblage of symptoms, a close
and discriminating attention, and to adapt, with equal care, a
corresponding treatment in medicine, diet and general management;
to do this within a limited space of time, requires a concentration
of all the energies of the mind in a degree scarcely
compatible with attention to any other subject. Under such
circumstances, it is difficult in the extreme, to dispossess the
mind of the engrossing anxiety just described, so as to leave it
sufficiently free for availing itself of any suitable moment for
introducing, with needful delicacy and tenderness, the all-important
subject of eternity. How frequently, too, have we
found that by the time we have completed our medical inquiries
and directions, the patient has become too much exhausted to
render any further exertion safe or practicable!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span></p>

<p>In addition to the obstacles already specified, you have probably,
my dear friend, sometimes encountered opposition from
the mistaken kindness of the patient’s relatives, who have
deemed it next to madness to endanger the comfortable
serenity of one “whose goodness of heart,” they persuade
themselves, “must secure him a happy hereafter.” Generally,
however, the confidence reposed in the kindness and discretion
of the medical attendant, will soon allay such a feeling of alarm,
and afford the assurance that nothing will be attempted of a
doubtful or hazardous character.</p>

<p>But the most formidable hindrance, I apprehend, exists
<em>within ourselves</em>. I refer to the prevailing impression among
us, that the religious welfare of a patient is foreign to our
province; that to aim, in any direct manner, at promoting it, is
superfluous, if not also obtrusive; and that the attempt might
be regarded, moreover, as an unbecoming interference with the
sacred office. The <em>sedative</em> influence of this opinion is often
rendered still more paralysing by a consciousness of not possessing
the facility and tact supposed to be essential to the
success of the effort. Hence, opportunities for speaking “a
word in season,” are scarcely looked for or desired. The mind,
at length, rests satisfied with an abandonment of the matter, as
hopeless and impracticable, not duly considering <em>whose cause it
is</em>, nor recollecting the divine promise that “strength shall be
made perfect in weakness.”</p>

<p>Such, my valued friend, are among the difficulties in our way;
great, indeed, we must allow them to be, yet, happily, they are
not insurmountable.</p>

<p>Assuming, for the moment, that the duties and qualifications
of the medical practitioner do not impose upon him a higher
degree of responsibility, relative to the spiritual good of his
patient, than attaches to every other well-informed Christian,
in reference to his neighbor, I may safely assert that the profession
of medicine does in no wise release its member from a duty
common to all Christians—that of embracing every opportunity
to testify their gratitude to the adorable Saviour, and their
anxious desire to extend the blessings of redeeming mercy to
those who “are ready to perish.” But the assumption itself is
incorrect; for it would not be difficult to prove that the favorable
opportunities and peculiar facilities possessed by the physician
do proportionably <em>augment</em> his responsibility, and the consequent
amount of obligation. Nor can this fearful responsibility
be evaded, by a general impression of our unfitness for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
task, unless we can conscientiously affirm that we have tried to
the utmost—that we have done all that we were able to do.</p>

<p>As regards the alleged interference with the ministerial
office, I may truly say that, to the extent of my own observation,
the apprehension is entirely groundless. So far removed,
indeed, are the judicious, well-timed suggestions of the physician,
in relation to the immortal interests of his patient, from
anything like interference with the sacred function, that, in the
instances in which they are most needed, they may be strictly
regarded as <em>precursory</em> and introductory to the more direct
instructions of the minister; as opening a way for him which
would otherwise be closed, as removing ill-founded objections to
his assistance, and enkindling a desire for his spiritual counsel.
In many other instances, the Christian physician proves a
powerful <em>auxiliary</em> to the faithful minister of Christ, especially
by facilitating his visits, pointing out at what time, under what
circumstances, and to what extent, the patient may be likely to
attend, with safety and advantage, to “the things which make
for his eternal peace.” I have good reason, indeed, to believe
that the enlightened ambassadors of the Saviour, so far from
entertaining a feeling of jealousy, do really hail with cordial
satisfaction such auxiliaries, in their trying visits to the bed of
sickness and death; persuaded that none can feel a deeper
interest than a Christian physician, in the well-being of <em>the
whole man</em>, bodily and spiritually, in reference to eternity as
well as to time. And how can jealousy be felt? Is not the
glory of his Divine Master in the salvation of immortal souls,
the supreme object of every pious minister’s pursuit? If so,
even the feeblest attempt to subserve the same cause must gain
his hearty concurrence. Happily, the un-scriptural, un-Protestant
notion of religious instruction devolving exclusively on the
clergy has become obsolete. As well might the Bible itself be
read and studied by them alone. The very constitution, indeed,
of our most efficient religious institutions speaks a contrary language;
especially that of the visiting and district societies, in
which the principle of lay co-operation is clearly recognized,
and the obligation thence arising is fully avowed. In truth, it
requires but little sagacity to predict that, in the noble enterprise
now in progress for evangelizing the world, the zealous
exertions of Christians generally will be more and more called
forth. Such an active and pervading influence seems evidently
implied in the prophecy of Jeremiah, as cited by the apostle of
the Gentiles, alluding to the period when “they shall not teach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
<em>every man</em> his neighbor, and <em>every man</em> his brother, saying,
‘know the Lord;’ for all shall know me, from the least unto the
greatest.” We have yet, indeed, to realize the happy day
when, even comparatively, <em>every</em> man shall seek the spiritual
good of his neighbor; but we are surely authorized to expect it,
as well as bound to hasten it, by earnest prayer and vigorous
endeavor. We are even encouraged to anticipate the more
distant and glorious period, when the omnipotent Saviour shall
have given complete efficiency to the universal labor of love,
and when “He shall be all in all.”</p>

<p>Not to weary your patience further, I will here close my
letter; hoping, in a second communication, to present a few
<em>encouragements</em> which may serve to cheer you under the difficulties
we have been considering. I shall endeavor also to add
some practical suggestions, in reference to the most eligible
<em>methods</em> of introducing the subject of religion to persons dangerously
ill. Of the power of executing the latter part of my task,
especially, I cannot but entertain much self-distrust.</p>

<h3>LETTER II.</h3>

<p class="center no-indent">ON THE ENCOURAGEMENT TO BE EXPECTED IN THE ATTEMPT.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p>In my former communication I placed before you the considerations
which had most impressed my own mind, in reference
to the <em>importance</em> of aiming to promote the spiritual
welfare of the sick. You will have observed that, far from
concealing, I fully admitted the difficulties attendant on the
effort, while I endeavored to show that they were by no means
insurmountable. I am now desirous of presenting to your
attention a few of the <em>encouragements</em> which the physician is
warranted to expect in pursuing this “work of faith and labor
of love.” Such, I apprehend, will be found to arise from <span class="smcap">the
peculiar facilities which the profession affords; from
the Divine benediction which may be humbly, yet confidently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
anticipated; and from the success which has
already crowned similar efforts.</span></p>

<p>1.—No one who has witnessed the respect and confidence
with which the suggestions of a conscientious physician are
received, can doubt of his possessing an almost unlimited influence
in the sick chamber. He has become, in truth, the attached
friend of the family, to whom they freely unbosom their
sorrows and their fears, particularly such as appear to be inducing
or aggravating any existing or threatened disease. Hence
the medical adviser, having gained an important acquaintance
with the mental constitution of his patient, its individual peculiarities
and tendencies, and with the varying complexion of
thought and feeling which bodily disturbance has been wont to
excite, is already prepared to introduce with delicacy and
address, such incidental remarks in reference to his highest
interests as the peculiar condition of the sufferer may naturally
call forth; and in the way best adapted to interest and impress,
while least likely to endanger that general quietude, on the
maintenance of which his recovery may materially depend.
Being aware, moreover, of the different aspect in which other
topics of practical importance have at various times appeared to
his patient, or to persons under similar circumstances, while
viewed through the distorting medium of disease, he will not be
surprised if the momentous subject of religion should also share
(so far as natural effects may be permitted) in the obliquity or
indistinctness of the mental vision. The same previous knowledge
will often enable him to calculate, with tolerable precision,
the degree of influence, whether exciting or depressing,
which an allusion to the realities of eternity may be likely to
exert on the patient’s bodily frame; and thus to attemper
and apportion his suggestions to the particular exigencies of
the case.</p>

<p>2.—Among the <em>facilities</em> to which we have adverted, I cannot
but regard as one of the most valuable, that arising from
the numerous opportunities possessed by the physician of connecting
in the most easy and natural manner, some serious
remark with his medical counsel. So intimately, indeed, is the
mind united to the body, and so generally does the one sympathize
with the sufferings of the other, as constantly to demand
a considerable portion of the physician’s vigilance and discrimination.
He cannot but observe the baneful influence of agitating
and corroding emotions, in thwarting every healing expedient;
and being constrained, therefore, to inculcate the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
importance of tranquillity, acquiescence, and cheering hope, he
is led by the most gentle transition to trace those virtues to the
true source of “every good and perfect gift,” and to the surpassing
value and efficacy of the Saviour’s peace, and of the “hope
that maketh not ashamed.”</p>

<p>You have often, my friend, observed in the moment of danger,
with what eager, anxious attention the patient listens to every
word that falls from his physician. He knows that his friend
and counsellor is deeply concerned for his well-being, and can
have no interest apart from his. He is aware of the value of
professional time, and has experienced the unwearied assiduities
which have been exerted for the preservation of his life. Should,
therefore, the physician appear to overstep the precise boundary
of his province while touching upon the concerns of immortality,
the patient, I am persuaded, will usually regard the solicitude
thereby evinced, as an additional and gratifying proof of genuine
friendship. The sick man has also the tranquillizing conviction,
that nothing is likely to proceed from his judicious adviser
which would either aggravate the disease, or interfere with the
salutary operation of remedies. Hence, no alarm, no perturbation
is induced; while two or three well-adapted hints are
gaining a quiet admission into the mind, and affording useful
materials for private meditation and self-inquiry. Now, my
dear friend, if such be the advantageous position of a humane
and Christian physician in the chamber of sickness, and I am
sure your own observation will verify the statement, how deep
must be the regret that such ’vantage ground has ever been
lost, yea, lost for ever! That where the sick man’s anxious
eye betokened confidence, expectation, desire, we should have
allowed so fair an opportunity to pass away, without affectionately
and urgently directing him to “Behold the Lamb of God!”
I will not again expatiate on the serious responsibility which
these facilities involve, but I respectfully entreat my professional
brethren to be on their guard, lest timidity, apathy, or
worldly policy should deprive them of the exalted privilege of
being instrumental in saving a soul from death, and thus adding
another jewel to the Redeemer’s crown. It may still be said,
that the afflicted patient will not be disposed to listen to the
<em>religious</em> advice of his physician, considering it as altogether
foreign to his department. I believe, on the contrary, that such
advice, when tendered with kindness and discretion, will generally
be regarded the more highly because it is <em>not</em> professional,
because it is <em>not</em> a matter of course, but springing spontaneously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
from the lively interest which the physician feels in the entire
welfare of his charge. This view of the subject seems to me
quite compatible with the sincerest respect for the labors of a
Christian minister in the time of sickness. His invaluable
instructions have the weight and sanction of official character;
while, from the aptitude afforded by kindred studies and pastoral
duties, they may be expected to possess an appropriateness not
otherwise attainable. They are held, moreover, in high estimation,
because they are regular and ministerial; whereas the
religious hints of the physician, as I have before remarked,
acquire much of their interest and influence from the very opposite
consideration,—from the fact of their being occasional, unexpected,
and spontaneous.</p>

<p>3.—The powerful incentive arising from <em>an humble expectation
of the Divine blessing</em>, appears to me fully authorized. If
I have adequately shown the importance of the endeavor, and
have satisfactorily proved that the peculiar facilities afforded to
the physician, involve a proportionate amount of obligation (in
those cases, at least, which have not and perhaps cannot have,
the advantage of ministerial instruction,) it will follow, as a
necessary consequence, that in performing a Christian duty of
such moment, we are warranted to implore and to expect the
special aid of Omnipotence. The object at which we aim is
nothing less than the glory of the Divine Saviour, in the salvation
of an immortal soul, and how cheering are the assurances
of infallible truth,—“I will make my strength perfect in weakness.”
“Him that honoreth me, I will honor!” “He that
converteth a sinner from the error of his ways, shall save a soul
from death, and hide a multitude of sins.”</p>

<p>And let not my valued friend be discouraged at the difficulty of
the undertaking. The cause is God’s. He hath all hearts in
his hand, all events at his disposal, and is often pleased to
effectuate the greatest designs by the most feeble instrumentality,
in order to show that “the excellency of the power is not
in man, but in God” alone. Far be it from me to depreciate
the value of prudence and discretion in an attempt of such
importance; but I am bound to confess that the danger has not
generally arisen from the neglect of cautionary maxims, but
from permitting them to obtain an undue and paralysing influence.
Where eternity is at stake, let us not be exclusively
guided by the cold, calculating axioms of worldly policy. Selfishness
may whisper, “Am I my brother’s keeper?” and as the
priest and the Levite in the parable of the good Samaritan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>
were probably willing to persuade themselves that there spiritual
functions imposed upon them no obligation to afford <em>bodily</em> succor
to the “wounded, half-dead man,”—so, my friend, may we
be in danger of resting satisfied in withholding our spiritual aid
from our dying patients, on the hollow and untenable ground
that our responsibility extends only to the body and to time.
Oh! let us be rather like the good Samaritan, and without hesitation
or delay, endeavor to pour into the wounded spirit the
wine and oil of heavenly consolation,—thus adopting our blessed
Lord’s special application of the parable—“Go, and do thou
likewise!” Surely we may confidently hope that in rendering
this obedience, we shall experience super-human aid; and
though our path may be dark and rugged, and the obstacles
many and powerful, yet may we cheerfully and implicitly rely
on that Almighty God, who is “a Sun and a Shield” to those
who put their trust in Him.</p>

<p>May I not add as a collateral encouragement, that while thus
aiming to promote the honor of the Divine Emanuel, we may
humbly hope that he may be “<em>with us</em>,” in granting efficiency
to our strictly professional exertions? When it is considered
that the skilful or unskilful decision of a moment may save or
lose a valuable life, and that even a well-selected remedy may
prove salutary or detrimental as the Divine benediction is
vouchsafed or withheld, how inconceivably important must we
regard the guidance and the smile of Him, “in whom we live
and move, and have our being,” and in whom are all our
springs of intelligence and of usefulness! By “seeking the
kingdom of God and his righteousness” in the way we have
described, we may be rendered the happy instruments of giving
occasion to our grateful patients, to unite with the sweet singer
of Israel, in ascribing from their inmost souls, blessing and
praise to Jehovah, for having not only “forgiven all their iniquities,”
but also “healed all their diseases.”</p>

<p>One especial ground of encouragement yet remains—that
which rests upon <em>the actual success with which the God of all
grace has been pleased to crown similar efforts</em>. He, who hath
all power in heaven and on earth, <em>has</em> given efficiency to such
exertions: and while, with “a single eye to His glory,” they
are “begun, continued, and ended in Him,” we cannot doubt
that the ardent desire and persevering endeavor to rescue immortal
souls from endless perdition will be accompanied by
these gracious influences which can at once direct, and animate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>
and bless. Thus, “our labors shall not be in vain in the
Lord.”</p>

<p>It has already been remarked, that, in aiming to subserve
the spiritual as well as temporal interests of our patients, we
shall usually retain, if not increase, their confidence and regard.
Sometimes, however, it may prove otherwise; especially in reference
to the relatives and friends of the sick. This was strikingly
evinced in the experience of an aged and eminent, but now deceased
physician, then practising in Westminster, as communicated
by him to the writer of this letter. The veteran practitioner
was called to the bedside of a young lady, whom he found passing
to her long home, yet destitute of hope, unacquainted with
the way to Christ, and peace, and heaven, and surrounded by
relatives equally ignorant with herself. He placed in the hands
of her attentive and (as it afterwards appeared) pious nurse, a
volume of the “Village Sermons,” requesting that a portion
might be occasionally read to the youthful patient. On getting
out of his carriage on his next visit, he was met by the mother,
and thus abruptly accosted—“I will not trouble you to go up
stairs;” assigning no motive for so unceremonious a dismission,
except such as might be read in a countenance of high displeasure.
My sagacious friend at once penetrated her mind, and retired.
After some time had elapsed, the nurse informed him that the
young lady lived but a few days after his visit, yet long enough
to afford a delightful evidence of having obtained pardon and
peace through a crucified Redeemer. The very volume, it
appeared, that excluded the physician from the family, was rendered
instrumental in introducing the dying patient into spiritual
life. And never can I forget the pious elevation and the
grateful emphasis, with which my venerable friend closed his
affecting narrative: “cheerfully,” said he, “would I lose the
best family in my professional connection, if by my feeble instrumentality
I could be the means of saving another soul from
death.”</p>

<p>Thus, my dear friend, I have endeavored to set before you
the principal encouragements for the endeavor. I have still
to accomplish the most difficult part of my task—that of submitting
to you a few suggestions on the <em>mode</em> of communicating
serious counsel to the sick. This I must attempt in a
future letter.</p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>

<p class="center no-indent">ON THE MOST ELIGIBLE METHODS TO BE PURSUED.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p>In accordance with your request, I now proceed to offer a
few suggestions derived from personal observation, on the
methods which appear to me best calculated to secure the important
object of our present correspondence. You will remember,
that, even at a distance, I doubted my ability for properly
executing this part of the undertaking; and I candidly own
that my consciousness of inadequacy has not diminished on a
nearer view of the attending difficulties. Should, however, the
plain remarks you are about to receive, possess little value in
themselves, they may, I am willing to hope, prove indirectly
useful, by engaging your own attention more closely and continuously
to the subject.</p>

<p>You are too well aware, how deeply the feeling of medical
responsibility has pressed upon myself, to suppose for a single
moment, that I would inconsiderately superadd to a similar
burthen upon you any unnecessary weight of obligation as connected
with the spiritual condition of your patients. I cannot,
indeed, relinquish the opinion I have deliberately formed, and
which has been before avowed, namely, that the peculiar facilities
afforded to the medical practitioner entail upon him a proportionate
responsibility; yet am I very solicitous not to endanger
the peace of a conscientious mind, by incautious or exaggerated
statements, or by urging the adoption of any doubtful
or impracticable measures. On a subject of such manifest delicacy
as well as difficulty, it is highly important that our views
should be well defined, and our opinions of the duties and obligations
involved, most carefully guarded and qualified, otherwise
we may not only inflict a needless wound on a pious
mind, but may actually defeat the very object we desire to promote,
by the disheartening influence of plans of operation unfeasible
in themselves, or inconsistent with our proper, indispensable,
and untransferable duties. Allow me, therefore, to
request your attention to two preliminary observations.</p>

<p>First,—I would remark that the desire of promoting the
patient’s religious welfare should never be allowed to interfere
with the thorough performance of medical duties. These cannot
be superseded by any other claims. Under this decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
impression I would suggest, as a general rule, the propriety of
giving your sole, undivided attention to the relief of the
patient’s malady, as well as to every circumstance and arrangement
which his bodily condition may demand, before you permit
yourself to advert to his spiritual exigences. You will
kindly observe that I recommend this as a <em>general</em> rule, which
may possibly admit of some exceptions. For example, I can
conceive that some highly-gifted individuals may have the
power of interspersing, in an unobjectionable manner, a few religious
hints among their medical enquiries and directions, and
without materially distracting their attention, or endangering
the temporal well-being of their charge. Yet, even with such
facilities, there would sometimes, I apprehend, be a risk of dispersing
those energies of mind which the physician ought assuredly,
in the first place, to concentrate on his patient, in the
earnest, persevering endeavor to remove his disease and preserve
his life. Consequently the talent referred to should be
used with much judgment and caution. But I foresee that
your habits of discrimination will lead you to doubt whether
the example I have supposed really constitutes an exception to
the rule. It certainly is not foreign to the <em>spirit</em> of the rule,
which I think may be thus expressed:—that no attempt should
be made by the physician to promote the religious welfare of the
sick, which is incompatible with the full, efficient, satisfactory
discharge of his medical duties and obligations.</p>

<p>The second preliminary relates to the distinction which it is
important to mark between that <em>general</em> responsibility which, in
my humble opinion, requires the physician to be always on the
alert to profit by every incidental opportunity of employing his
influence for the spiritual good of his patient; and that <em>special</em>
obligation which may sometimes devolve upon him, (in consequence
of the total absence of religious instruction,) to attempt,
in a more particular manner, to rescue the sinking soul from
perdition, and direct it to Him, who is able “to save to the uttermost.”
This distinction leads me to propose, as a second general
rule, that, inasmuch as religious instruction forms a part of
ministerial and relative duty, it would be highly inexpedient for
the physician to add to his already onerous engagements, that
of undertaking the spiritual supervision of his patient, except
under circumstances of imperious necessity. Whenever, therefore
the aid of a Christian minister or a pious relation can be
obtained, the medical practitioner may, I conceive, regard himself
as free from any special obligation of that nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span></p>

<p>These limitations obviously imply that, in by far the greater
number of instances, the religious influence of the physician
should be exercised in an occasional, rather than in a stated
and formal manner. If alive to the spiritual welfare of his
patient, such opportunities of usefulness will not be wanting.
Perhaps, nothing would so essentially contribute to the furtherance
of the object, as the offering up of earnest supplications to
the “Father of lights,” for His especial guidance and help,
before the physician enters upon his daily engagements, that
he may be enabled both to discern and improve every suitable
opportunity, which even in the ordinary exercise of his
profession may be presented, of doing good to the souls of
his patients.</p>

<p>In seeking, and humbly expecting, thus to employ your influence
in this sacred cause, I feel the most encouraging persuasion
that “your labors will not be in vain in the Lord.”</p>

<p>It may be convenient to arrange the few thoughts which
have occurred to me in reference to the <em>mode</em> of offering “a
word in season” in a few leading particulars; premising that,
next to the Divine blessing, the secret of usefulness will be
found, I humbly anticipate, in the careful, discriminating adaptation
of advice to the particular circumstances of the case. Age,
sex, degree of intellect and cultivation, particular habits of body
and of mind, the actual stage of the disease, the hopes and fears
of the patient in relation to futurity, the religious knowledge
already possessed, the presence or absence of spiritual instruction,
and many other circumstances, will, I am persuaded,
appear to you deserving of special consideration. I can, therefore,
only hope to suggest a few general principles which may
be indefinitely modified and applied, according to the varied
and ever-varying circumstances of each individual case.</p>

<p>My first suggestion has already been anticipated. I refer to
the importance of recommending and even urging the assistance
of a Christian minister or a pious friend, in cases of serious
and dangerous illness. I am aware that the very mention of
the subject is sometimes productive of considerable alarm, and
certainly requires much prudence and caution. With skilful
management, however, the exciting of any injurious degree of
apprehension and foreboding may generally, I would hope, be
avoided. One may say, for example, in the course of conversation,
to a patient apparently unconcerned or uninstructed in
reference to Eternity, “You must find the change from active
life to the confinement of this room rather irksome. Yet some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
time for calm reflection is really needful for us all. When withdrawn
from busy life, we can look upon the world at a distance,
as well as come into closer contact with ourselves. Indeed,
serious consideration can never be unsuitable. Human life
itself is confessedly uncertain, and of course, under disease,
still more so. Should you not find a little conversation with a
pious minister interesting under your present circumstances?”
In this familiar way, (pardon its homeliness,) one may sometimes
introduce the subject without abruptness. From having
had much personal illness, I have been able to press the matter
further, by assuring the patient that such assistance has repeatedly
proved very consolatory to my own mind; thus, presenting
a living instance of the incorrectness of the popular
opinion that, to propose the visit of a minister to the sick, is
tantamount to a death-warrant.</p>

<p>Should the recommendation prove entirely fruitless; should
the unhappy patient, notwithstanding our utmost professional
efforts, be so rapidly hastening into eternity as to afford no
opportunity of procuring more efficient spiritual aid, the case
will then present one of those <em>special</em> occasions before alluded to,
which call for our more immediate and devoted attention, in
reference to the immortal spirit. And who, that values his own
soul, would not, under such circumstances, endeavor with all
possible earnestness and affection, to exhibit to the dying man
the compassionate and Almighty Redeemer, as able to save
even at the eleventh hour?</p>

<p>I may next suggest that the allusions of the physician to the
subject of religion should generally be <em>incidental</em> and conversational;
arising spontaneously from a solicitous regard to the particular
situation of the sufferer. When such occasional advice
appears naturally to flow from the heart, partaking of the disposition
and character of the speaker, and having an evident bearing
on the special circumstances of the patient, there will be
little risk of its being regarded as superfluous or obtrusive. On
the contrary, I believe, it will usually be welcomed as a gratifying
proof of disinterested friendship. In this incidental way,
one may sometimes refer to the experience of great and good
men under similar sufferings, and to the signal support vouchsafed
to them, and to the happy results of their afflictions. On
some occasions, it may be useful to adduce the remarkable
fact, that some of the brightest ornaments of the Church and
of the world have ascribed much of their success in life to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>
discipline they were once called to endure in the chamber of
sickness and seclusion.</p>

<p>May I add, that the occasional hints of the physician should
also be <em>brief</em>? A single sentence well-timed, well-directed,
appropriate, and expressive, will possess the great advantage
of not wearying the attention of the sufferer, while it may, notwithstanding,
supply ample material for reflection during the
succeeding hours of solitude and silence. “<em>A word</em> spoken in
season, how good it is!”</p>

<p>Nor is it less important, I conceive, that such advice be expressed
with <em>clearness and simplicity</em>, in a few plain words
and short sentences, bearing a direct and obvious meaning, and
free from ambiguity and circumlocution.</p>

<p>Allow me also to suggest that the advice should be <em>considerate
and kind</em>; the evident effect of genuine sympathy and tender
concern. No word should be dropped that might seem to
imply an unmindfulness of the suffering, helpless, unresisting
state of the patient, or oblige him to attempt a lengthened and
laborious reply. One kind sentence delivered in a tone of kindness,
and accompanied with a look of kindness, may, and often
will, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">juvante Deo</i>, penetrate the heart.</p>

<p>In certain states of disease, in which high excitement, or
extreme debility prevails, it may sometimes be expedient to
address a passing hint to a relative or friend who may be present
rather than to the patient himself, thus leaving to the option
of the latter, whether or not to reply to the observation.</p>

<p>Yet should the hints be <em>faithful</em>. Any approach to temporizing
would be cruel in itself, and might prove fatally delusive
in its consequences. It would be, in effect, to administer a
moral opiate, from which the helpless victim might awake—only
in Eternity.</p>

<p>Permit me also to remark that, whenever the circumstances
of the case will permit, our allusions to spiritual subjects should
be <em>attractive and encouraging</em>. Doubtless, the torpid insensibility
of the sinner may require to be roused by an alarming
representation of the direful consequences of transgression and
unbelief; nor can we reasonably expect that mercy will be
sought until it be felt to be needed. In general, however, I apprehend,
that a cheering exhibition of the Almighty Saviour,
as “full of grace and truth,” as “ready to forgive,” and “plenteous
in mercy to all who call upon Him,” will be found most
effectual in softening the heart, and in exciting those earnest
desires for pardon and acceptance, which are emphatically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
described, in our Lord’s own test of sincerity, in the case of
Saul,—“Behold, he prayeth.” Let us, my friend, never forget
that “he who <em>winneth</em> souls is wise.” The promises of the
gospel are, indeed, peculiarly adapted to meet the exigencies of
the afflicted and distressed. The blessed Redeemer was pleased
to described himself as having come purposely “to seek and to
save that which was lost.” Were we even restricted to the
use of a single sentence, as a scriptural <em>vade-mecum</em> in the sick
chamber, we should still have a volume of encouragement and
consolation in our Lord’s assurance,—“Him that cometh to me,
I will in no wise cast out.”</p>

<p>Upon the whole, my dear friend, the best preparation for
speaking “a word in season” will be found in carefully studying
the example, and seeking to imbibe the spirit, of the incarnate
Saviour, that all-perfect Physician of the soul and of the
body. What a lovely union of simplicity and sincerity, of
faithfulness and tenderness, pervaded <em>His</em> addresses to the sick
and afflicted! How much is comprised in that short sentence,
“The gentleness of Christ!” He did “not break the bruised
reed nor quench the smoking flax; but came to bind up the
broken-hearted,” and heal their every wound. May we be enabled
by grace from on high, though necessarily in a very humble
measure, to tread in His steps!</p>

<p>In truth, <em>the Christian-like deportment</em> of the physician
comprises within itself a sphere of very important usefulness,
affording ample scope for the development of those graces and
affections which characterise the sincere follower of the meek
and forbearing, the benevolent and sympathizing Saviour. And
even should my friend find it sometimes difficult or impracticable
to offer a word of spiritual counsel as he could wish, he may
yet, in his habitual demeanor, present to the patient and the
surrounding relatives, a living “epistle” which they can read
and understand, and which, by directing them to the source of
every good gift, may issue in the attainment of true and saving
wisdom.</p>

<p>In concluding this letter, I must not altogether omit to refer
to <em>the season of convalescence</em>, as peculiarly favorable to religious
impression. If ever the mind and the heart be open to
the feelings of gratitude, love and praise, it is under the circumstances
of returning ease and health, and in the hope of being
again permitted to enter on the duties and enjoyments of life.
It is then that the physician, in my humble opinion, is more
especially bound to avail himself of the grateful attachment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
his patient by referring any skill or care he may have evinced
to the God of all grace, and thus endeavor to give a right direction
to those kind and gladsome emotions, which are bursting
from a full heart. It is then, I conceive, that the rescue
from the grave should be held out as a signal warning, and as a
powerful incentive. Then, also, by adroitly following out the
convalescent’s own suggestions, a powerful appeal may be made
to his best feelings, and an affectionate plea presented for an
immediate and entire surrender of himself, “body, soul, and
spirit,” unto an Almighty and most merciful Father, who “hath
redeemed his life from destruction, and crowned him with loving
kindness and tender mercies.”</p>

<p>At such a period, too, we may often recommend, with great
advantage, some interesting volume adapted to our patient’s
state. Biography and easy letters, as being both interesting
and not requiring much effort of attention, will often be found
peculiarly acceptable. Indeed, the judicious recommendation
of books and tracts may be regarded as an important mode of
employing our influence during every period of illness, but particularly
during the season of convalescence.</p>

<p>Such, my dear friend, are the few imperfect hints which
have occurred to me. I might, indeed, have availed myself of
the assistance of some valuable writers on the subject of affliction,
particularly of the highly interesting work of my pious
and intellectual friend, Mr. Sheppard, “<em>On Christian Encouragement
and Consolation</em>;” and the excellent “<em>Thoughts in
Affliction</em>,” by another able friend, the Rev. A. S. Thelwall.
I might also have enriched these humble letters by a reference to
the “<em>Essays to do Good</em>,” of the eminent Dr. Cotton Mather,
which contain some admirable suggestions on the same subject.
From these several works I have formerly derived much instruction
and pleasure, but was unwilling to have recourse to
them on the present occasion, as well as from the wish of
not unnecessarily extending these letters, as in compliance with
your particular desire that I would send you the result of my
own observation and experience.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">OF THE DUTIES OF PHYSICIANS TO THEIR PATIENTS AND OF THE
OBLIGATIONS OF PATIENTS TO THEIR PHYSICIANS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span>—<em>Duties of physicians to their patients.</em></p>

<p>§ 1. A physician should not only be ever ready to obey the
calls of the sick, but his mind ought also to be imbued with the
greatness of his mission, and the responsibility he habitually
incurs in its discharge. Those obligations are the more deep
and enduring, because there is no tribunal other than his own
conscience, to adjudge penalties for carelessness or neglect.
Physicians should, therefore, minister to the sick with due impressions
of the importance of their office; reflecting that the
ease, the health, and the lives of those committed to their charge,
depend on their skill, attention and fidelity. They should study,
also, in their deportment, so to unite <em>tenderness</em> with <em>firmness</em>,
and <em>condescension</em> with <em>authority</em>, as to inspire the minds of
their patients with gratitude, respect and confidence.</p>

<p>§ 2. Every case committed to the charge of a physician
should be treated with attention, steadiness and humanity.
Reasonable indulgence should be granted to the mental imbecility
and caprices of the sick. Secrecy and delicacy, when
required by peculiar circumstances, should be strictly observed;
and the familiar and confidential intercourse to which physicians
are admitted in their professional visits, should be used with
discretion, and with the most scrupulous regard to fidelity and
honor. The obligation of secrecy extends beyond the period
of professional services;—none of the privacies of personal and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
domestic life, no infirmity of disposition or flaw of character
observed during professional attendance, should ever be divulged
by him except when he is imperatively required to do so. The
force and necessity of this obligation are indeed so great, that
professional men have, under certain circumstances, been protected
in their observance of secrecy, by courts of justice.</p>

<p>§ 3. Frequent visits to the sick are in general requisite, since
they enable the physician to arrive at a more perfect knowledge
of the disease,—to meet promptly every change that may occur,
and also tend to preserve the confidence of the patient. But
unnecessary visits are to be avoided, as they give useless anxiety
to the patient, tend to diminish the authority of the physician,
and render him liable to be suspected of interested motives.</p>

<p>§ 4. A physician should not be forward to make gloomy
prognostications, because they savor of empiricism, by magnifying
the importance of his services in the treatment or cure of
the disease. But he should not fail, on proper occasions, to
give to the friends of the patient timely notice of danger, when it
really occurs; and even to the patient himself, if absolutely
necessary. This office, however, is so peculiarly alarming
when executed by him, that it ought to be declined whenever
it can be assigned to any other person of sufficient judgment
and delicacy. For, the physician should be the minister of hope
and comfort to the sick; that, by such cordials to the drooping
spirit, he may smooth the bed of death, revive expiring life, and
counteract the depressing influence of those maladies which
often disturb the tranquillity of the most resigned, in their last
moments. The life of a sick person can be shortened not only
by the acts, but also by the words or the manner of a physician.
It is, therefore, a sacred duty to guard himself carefully in this
respect, and to avoid all things which have a tendency to discourage
the patient and to depress his spirits.</p>

<p>§ 5. A physician ought not to abandon a patient because
the case is deemed incurable; for his attendance may continue
to be highly useful to the patient, and comforting to the relatives
around him, even in the last period of a fatal malady, by
alleviating pain and other symptoms, and by soothing mental
anguish. To decline attendance, under such circumstances,
would be sacrificing to fanciful delicacy and mistaken liberality,
that moral duty, which is independent of, and far superior to all
pecuniary consideration.</p>

<p>§ 6. Consultations should be promoted in difficult or protracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
cases, as they give rise to confidence, energy, and more
enlarged views in practice.</p>

<p>§ 7. The opportunity which a physician not unfrequently enjoys
of promoting and strengthening the good resolutions of his
patients, suffering under the consequences of vicious conduct,
ought never to be neglected. His counsels or even remonstrances,
will give satisfaction, not offence, if they be proffered
with politeness and evince a genuine love of virtue, accompanied
by a sincere interest in the welfare of the person to
whom they are addressed.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span>—<em>Obligations of patients to their physicians.</em></p>

<p>§ 1. The members of the medical profession, upon whom are
enjoined the performance of so many important and arduous
duties towards the community, and who are required to make
so many sacrifices to comfort, ease, and health, for the welfare
of those who avail themselves of their services, certainly have
a right to expect and require, that their patients should entertain
a just sense of the duties which they owe to their medical
attendants.</p>

<p>§ 2. The first duty of a patient is, to select as his medical
adviser one who has received a regular professional education.
In no trade or occupation, do mankind rely on the skill of an
untaught artist; and in medicine, confessedly the most difficult
and intricate of the sciences, the world ought not to suppose
that knowledge is intuitive.</p>

<p>§ 3. Patients should prefer a physician, whose habits of life
are regular, and who is not devoted to company, pleasure, or to
any pursuit incompatible with his professional obligations. A
patient should, also, confide the care of himself and family, as much
as possible to one physician, for a medical man who has become
acquainted with the peculiarities of constitution, habits, and
predispositions, of those he attends, is more likely to be successful
in his treatment, than one who does not possess that
knowledge.</p>

<p>A patient who has thus selected his physician, should always
apply for advice in what may appear to him trivial cases, for
the most fatal results often supervene on the slightest accidents.
It is of still more importance that he should apply for assistance
in the forming stage of violent diseases; it is to a neglect
of this precept that medicine owes much of the uncertainty
and imperfection with which it has been reproached.</p>

<p>§ 4. Patients should faithfully and unreservedly communicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span>
to their physician the supposed cause of their disease. This is
the more important, as many diseases of a mental origin stimulate
those depending on external causes, and yet are only to be
cured by ministering to the mind diseased. A patient should
never be afraid of thus making his physician his friend and adviser;
he should always bear in mind that a medical man is under
the strongest obligations of secrecy. Even the female sex
should never allow feelings of shame or delicacy to prevent
their disclosing the seat, symptoms and causes of complaints
peculiar to them. However commendable a modest reserve
may be in the common occurrences of life, its strict observance
in medicine is often attended with the most serious consequences,
and a patient may sink under a painful and loathsome disease,
which might have been readily prevented had timely intimation
been given to the physician.</p>

<p>§ 5. A patient should never weary his physician with a tedious
detail of events or matters not appertaining to his disease.
Even as relates to his actual symptoms, he will convey much
more real information by giving clear answers to interrogatories
than by the most minute account of his own framing. Neither
should he obtrude the details of his business nor the history of
his family concerns.</p>

<p>§ 6. The obedience of a patient to the prescriptions of his
physician should be prompt and implicit. He should never permit
his own crude opinions as to their fitness, to influence his
attention to them. A failure in one particular may render an
otherwise judicious treatment dangerous, and even fatal. This
remark is equally applicable to diet, drink, and exercise. As
patients become convalescent they are very apt to suppose that
the rules prescribed for them may be disregarded, and the consequence,
but too often, is a relapse. Patients should never allow
themselves to be persuaded to take any medicine whatever,
that may be recommended to them by the self-constituted doctors
and doctresses, who are so frequently met with, and who
pretend to possess infallible remedies for the cure of every disease.
However simple some of their prescriptions may appear
to be, it often happens that they are productive of much mischief,
and in all cases they are injurious, by contravening the
plan of treatment adopted by the physician.</p>

<p>§ 7. A patient should, if possible, avoid even the <em>friendly
visits of a physician</em> who is not attending him,—and when he
does receive them, he should never converse on the subject of
his disease, as an observation may be made, without any intention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
of interference, which may destroy his confidence in the
course he is pursuing, and induce him to neglect the directions
prescribed to him. A patient should never send for a consulting
physician without the express consent of his own medical
attendant. It is of great importance that physicians should act
in concert; for, although their modes of treatment may be attended
with equal success, when employed singly, yet conjointly
they are very likely to be productive of disastrous results.</p>

<p>§ 8. When a patient wishes to dismiss his physician, justice
and common courtesy require that he should declare his reasons
for so doing.</p>

<p>§ 9. Patients should always, when practicable, send for their
physician in the morning, before his usual hour of going out;
for, by being early aware of the visits he has to pay during the
day, the physician is able to apportion his time in such a manner
as to prevent an interference of engagements. Patients
should also avoid calling on their medical adviser unnecessarily
during the hours devoted to meals or sleep. They should
always be in readiness to receive the visits of their physician,
as the detention of a few minutes is often of serious inconvenience
to him.</p>

<p>§ 10. A patient should, after his recovery, entertain a just
and enduring sense of the value of the services rendered him by
his physician; for these are of such a character, that no mere
pecuniary acknowledgment can repay or cancel them.</p>
<br>

<hr class="r30">

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">OF THE DUTIES OF PHYSICIANS TO EACH OTHER, AND TO THE
PROFESSION AT LARGE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span>—<em>Duties for the support of professional character.</em></p>

<p>§ 1. Every individual, on entering the profession, as he becomes
thereby entitled to all its privileges and immunities, incurs
an obligation to exert his best abilities to maintain its dignity
and honor, to exalt its standing, and to extend the bounds
of its usefulness. He should therefore observe strictly, such
laws as are instituted for the government of its members;—should
avoid all contumelious and sarcastic remarks relative to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
the faculty, as a body; and while, by unwearied diligence, he
resorts to every honorable means of enriching the science, he
should entertain a due respect for his seniors, who have, by
their labors, brought it to the elevated condition in which he
finds it.</p>

<p>§ 2. There is no profession, from the members of which greater
purity of character, and a higher standard of moral excellence
are required, than the medical; and to attain such eminence
is a duty every physician owes alike to his profession
and to his patients. It is due to the latter, as without it he
cannot command their respect and confidence, and to both, because
no scientific attainments can compensate for the want of
correct moral principles. It is also incumbent upon the faculty
to be temperate in all things, for the practice of physic requires
the unremitting exercise of a clear and vigorous understanding;
and, on emergencies for which no professional man should be
unprepared, a steady hand, an acute eye, and an unclouded
head may be essential to the well-being, and even to the life, of
a fellow creature.</p>

<p>§ 3. It is derogatory to the dignity of the profession, to resort
to public advertisements or private cards or handbills, inviting
the attention of individuals affected with particular diseases—publicly
offering advice and medicine to the poor gratis, or promising
radical cures; or to publish cases and operations in the
daily prints or suffer such publications to be made;—to invite
laymen to be present at operations,—to boast of cures and remedies,—to
adduce certificates of skill and success, or to perform
any other similar acts. These are the ordinary practices
of empirics, and are highly reprehensible in a regular physician.</p>

<p>§ 4. Equally derogatory to professional character is it, for a
physician to hold a patent for any surgical instrument, or medicine;
or to dispense a secret <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nostrum</i>, whether it be the composition
or exclusive property of himself, or of others. For, if
such nostrum be of real efficacy, any concealment regarding it is
inconsistent with beneficence and professional liberality; and, if
mystery alone give it value and importance, such craft implies
either disgraceful ignorance, or fraudulent avarice. It is also
reprehensible for physicians to give certificates attesting the
efficacy of patent or secret medicines, or in any way to promote
the use of them.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span>—<em>Professional services of physicians to each other.</em></p>

<p>§ 1. All practitioners of medicine, their wives, and their
children while under the paternal care, are entitled to the gratuitous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
services of any one or more of the faculty residing near
them, whose assistance may be desired. A physician afflicted
with disease is usually an incompetent judge of his own case;
and the natural anxiety and solicitude which he experiences at
the sickness of a wife, a child, or any one who by the ties of
consanguinity is rendered peculiarly dear to him, tend to obscure
his judgment and produce timidity and irresolution in his practice.
Under such circumstances, medical men are peculiarly dependent
on each other, and kind offices and professional aid should
always be cheerfully and gratuitously afforded. Visits ought
not, however, to be obtruded officiously; as such unasked civility
may give rise to embarrassment, or interfere with that choice,
on which confidence depends. But, if a distant member of the
faculty, whose circumstances are affluent, request attendance,
and an honorarium be offered, it should not be declined; for no
pecuniary obligation ought to be imposed, which the party receiving
it would wish not to incur.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span>—<em>Of the duties of physicians as respects vicarious
offices.</em></p>

<p>§ 1. The affairs of life, the pursuit of health, and the various
accidents and contingencies to which a medical man is peculiarly
exposed, sometimes require him temporarily to withdraw
from his duties to his patients, and to request some of his professional
brethren to officiate for him. Compliance with this
request is an act of courtesy, which should always be performed
with the utmost consideration for the interest and character of
the family physician, and when exercised for a short period,
all the pecuniary obligations for such service should be awarded
to him. But if a member of the profession neglect his business
in quest of pleasure and amusement, he cannot be considered
as entitled to the advantages of the frequent and long-continued
exercise of this fraternal courtesy, without awarding to
the physician who officiates the fees arising from the discharge
of his professional duties.</p>

<p>In obstetrical and important surgical cases, which give rise
to unusual fatigue, anxiety and responsibility, it is just that the
fees accruing therefrom should be awarded to the physician who
officiates.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span>—<em>Of the duties of physicians in regard to consultations.</em></p>

<p>§ 1. A regular medical education furnishes the only presumptive
evidence of professional abilities and acquirements, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>
ought to be the only acknowledged right of an individual to
the exercise and honors of his profession. Nevertheless, as in
consultations the good of the patient is the sole object in view,
and this is often dependent on personal confidence, no intelligent
regular practitioner, who has a license to practice from
some medical board of known and acknowledged respectability,
recognized by this association, and who is in good moral and
professional standing in the place in which he resides, should be
fastidiously excluded from fellowship, or his aid refused in consultation
when it is requested by the patient. But no one can
be considered as a regular practitioner, or a fit associate in consultation,
whose practice is based on an exclusive dogma, to
the rejection of the accumulated experience of the profession,
and of the aids actually furnished by anatomy, physiology,
pathology, and organic chemistry.</p>

<p>§ 2. In consultations no rivalship or jealousy should be indulged;
candor, probity, and all due respect should be exercised
towards the physician having charge of the case.</p>

<p>§ 3. In consultations the attending physician should be the
first to propose the necessary questions to the sick; after which
the consulting physician should have the opportunity to make
such farther inquiries of the patient as may be necessary to
satisfy him of the true character of the case. Both physicians
should then retire to a private place for deliberation; and the
one first in attendance should communicate the directions agreed
upon to the patient or his friends, as well as any opinions which
it may be thought proper to express. But no statement or discussion
of it should take place before the patient or his friends,
except in the presence of all the faculty attending, and by their
common consent; and <em>no opinions</em> or <em>prognostications</em> should be
delivered, which are not the result of previous deliberation and
concurrence.</p>

<p>§ 4. In consultations, the physician in attendance should deliver
his opinion first; and when there are several consulting,
they should deliver their opinions in the order in which they
have been called in. No decision, however, should restrain the
attending physician from making such variations in the mode
of treatment, as any subsequent unexpected change in the character
of the case may demand. But such variation and the
reasons for it ought to be carefully detailed at the next meeting
in consultation. The same privilege belongs also to the consulting
physician if he is sent for in an emergency, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>
regular attendant is out of the way, and similar explanations
must be made by him, at the next consultation.</p>

<p>§ 5. The utmost punctuality should be observed in the visits
of physicians when they are to hold consultation together, and
this is generally practicable, for society has been considerate
enough to allow the plea of a professional engagement to take
precedence of all others, and to be an ample reason for the relinquishment
of any present occupation. But as professional
engagements may sometimes interfere, and delay one of the parties,
the physician who first arrives should wait for his associate
a reasonable period, after which the consultation should be considered
as postponed to a new appointment. If it be the attending
physician who is present, he will of course see the patient
and prescribe; but if it be the consulting one, he should retire,
except in case of emergency, or when he has been called from a
considerable distance, in which latter case he may examine the
patient, and give his opinion in <em>writing</em>, and <em>under seal</em>, to be
delivered to his associate.</p>

<p>§ 6. In consultations, theoretical discussions should be avoided,
as occasioning perplexity and loss of time. For there may
be much diversity of opinion concerning speculative points, with
perfect agreement in those modes of practice which are founded,
not on hypothesis, but on experience and observation.</p>

<p>§ 7. All discussions in consultation should be held as secret
and confidential. Neither by words nor manner should any of
the parties to a consultation assert or insinuate, that any part of
the treatment pursued did not receive his assent. The responsibility
must be equally divided between the medical attendants,—they
must equally share the credit of success as well as the
blame of failure.</p>

<p>§ 8. Should an irreconcilable diversity of opinion occur when
several physicians are called upon to consult together, the opinion
of the majority should be considered as decisive; but if the
numbers be equal on each side, then the decision should rest
with the attending physician. It may, moreover, sometimes
happen, that two physicians cannot agree in their views of the nature
of a case, and the treatment to be pursued. This is a circumstance
much to be deplored, and should always be avoided, if
possible, by mutual concessions, as far as they can be justified
by a conscientious regard for the dictates of judgment. But in
the event of its occurrence, a third physician should, if practicable,
be called to act as umpire, and if circumstances prevent the
adoption of this course, it must be left to the patient to select<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
the physician in whom he is most willing to confide. But as
every physician relies upon the rectitude of his judgment, he
should, when left in the minority, politely and consistently retire
from any further deliberation in the consultation, or participation
in the management of the case.</p>

<p>§ 9. As circumstances sometimes occur to render a <em>special
consultation</em> desirable, when the continued attendance of two
physicians might be objectionable to the patient, the member of
the faculty whose assistance is required in such cases, should
sedulously guard against all future unsolicited attendance. As
such consultations require an extraordinary portion both of time
and attention, at least a double honorarium may be reasonably
expected.</p>

<p>§ 10. A physician who is called upon to consult, should observe
the most honorable and scrupulous regard for the character
and standing of the practitioner in attendance; the practice
of the latter, if necessary, should be justified as far as it can be,
consistently with a conscientious regard for truth, and no hint
or insinuation should be thrown out, which could impair the
confidence reposed in him, or affect his reputation. The consulting
physician should also carefully refrain from any of those
extraordinary attentions or assiduities, which are too often practiced
by the dishonest for the base purpose of gaining applause,
or ingratiating themselves into the favor of families and individuals.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span>—<em>Duties of physicians in cases of interference.</em></p>

<p>§ 1. Medicine is a liberal profession, and those admitted into
its ranks should found their expectations of practice upon the
extent of their qualifications, not on intrigue or artifice.</p>

<p>§ 2. A physician, in his intercourse with a patient under the
care of another practitioner, should observe the strictest caution
and reserve. No meddling inquiries should be made; no disingenuous
hints given relative to the nature and treatment of his
disorder; nor any course of conduct pursued that may directly
or indirectly tend to diminish the trust reposed in the physician
employed.</p>

<p>§ 3. The same circumspection and reserve should be observed,
when, from motives of business or friendship, a physician is
prompted to visit an individual who is under the direction of
another practitioner. Indeed, such visits should be avoided,
except under peculiar circumstances, and when they are made,
no particular inquiries should be instituted relative to the nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span>
of the disease, or the remedies employed, but the topics of conversation
should be as foreign to the case as circumstances will
admit.</p>

<p>§ 4. A physician ought not to take charge of, or prescribe for
a patient who has recently been under the care of another member
of the faculty in the same illness, except in cases of sudden
emergency, or in consultation with the physician previously in
attendance, or when the latter has relinquished the case or been
regularly notified that his services are no longer desired. Under
such circumstances no unjust and illiberal insinuations should
be thrown out in relation to the conduct or practice previously
pursued, which should be justified as far as candor and regard
for truth and probity will permit; for it often happens, that patients
become dissatisfied when they do not experience immediate
relief, and, as many diseases are naturally protracted,
the want of success, in the first stage of treatment, affords no
evidence of a lack of professional knowledge and skill.</p>

<p>§ 5. When a physician is called to an urgent case, because
the family attendant is not at hand, he ought, unless his assistance
in consultation be desired, to resign the care of the patient
to the latter immediately on his arrival.</p>

<p>§ 6. It oftens happens, in cases of sudden illness, or of recent
accidents and injuries, owing to the alarm and anxiety of
friends, that a number of physicians are simultaneously sent for.
Under these circumstances courtesy should assign the patient to
the first who arrives, who should select from those present any
additional assistance that he may deem necessary. In all such
cases, however, the practitioner who officiates, should request
the family physician, if there be one, to be called, and, unless
his further attendance be requested, should resign the case to the
latter on his arrival.</p>

<p>§ 7. When a physician is called to the patient of another
practitioner, in consequence of the sickness or absence of the
latter, he ought, on the return or recovery of the regular attendant,
and with the consent of the patient, to surrender the case.</p>

<p>§ 8. A physician, when visiting a sick person in the country,
may be desired to see a neighboring patient who is under the
regular direction of another physician, in consequence of some
sudden change or aggravation of symptoms. The conduct to
be pursued on such an occasion is to give advice adapted to
present circumstances; to interfere no farther than is absolutely
necessary with the general plan of treatment; to assume no
future direction, unless it be expressly desired; and, in this last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
case, to request an immediate consultation with the practitioner
previously employed.</p>

<p>§ 9. A wealthy physician should not give advice <em>gratis</em> to
the affluent; because his doing so is an injury to his professional
brethren. The office of a physician can never be supported
as an exclusively beneficent one; and it is defrauding,
in some degree, the common funds for its support, when fees are
dispensed with, which might, justly be claimed.</p>

<p>§ 10. When a physician who has been engaged to attend a
case of midwifery is absent, and another is sent for, if delivery
is accomplished during the attendance of the latter, he is entitled
to the fee, but should resign the patient to the practitioner
first engaged.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span>—<em>Of differences between physicians.</em></p>

<p>§ 1. Diversity of opinion, and opposition of interest, may, in
the medical, as in other professions, sometimes occasion controversy
and even contention. Whenever such cases unfortunately
occur, and cannot be immediately terminated, they should be
referred to the arbitration of a sufficient number of physicians,
or a <em>court-medical</em>.</p>

<p>As peculiar reserve must be maintained by physicians towards
the public, in regard to professional matters, and as there exists
numerous points in medical ethics and etiquette through which
the feelings of medical men may be painfully assailed in their
intercourse with each other, and which cannot be understood or
appreciated by general society, neither the subject matter of
such differences nor the adjudication of the arbitrators should
be made public, as publicity in a case of this nature may be
personally injurious to the individuals concerned, and can hardly
fail to bring discredit on the faculty.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span>—<em>Of pecuniary acknowledgments.</em></p>

<p>§ 1. Some general rules should be adopted by the faculty, in
every town or district, relative to <em>pecuniary acknowledgments</em>
from their patients; and it should be deemed a point of honor
to adhere to these rules with as much uniformity as varying circumstances
will admit.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">OF THE DUTIES OF THE PROFESSION TO THE PUBLIC, AND OF
THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE PUBLIC TO THE PROFESSION.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span>—<em>Duties of the profession to the public.</em></p>

<p>§ 1. As good citizens, it is the duty of physicians to be ever
vigilant for the welfare of the community, and to bear their part
in sustaining its institutions and burdens: they should also be
ever ready to give counsel to the public in relation to matters
especially appertaining to their profession, as on subjects of
medical police, public hygiène, and legal medicine. It is their
province to enlighten the public in regard to quarantine regulations,—the
location, arrangement, and dietaries of hospitals,
asylums, schools, prisons, and similar institutions,—in relation to
the medical police of towns, as drainage, ventilation, &amp;c.,—and
in regard to measures for the prevention of epidemic and contagious
diseases; and when pestilence prevails, it is their duty
to face the danger, and to continue their labors for the alleviation
of the suffering, even at the jeopardy of their own lives.</p>

<p>§ 2. Medical men should also be always ready, when called
on by the legally constituted authorities, to enlighten coroners’
inquests and courts of justice, on subjects strictly medical,—such
as involve questions relating to sanity, legitimacy, murder by
poisons or other violent means, and in regard to the various
other subjects embraced in the science of Medical Jurisprudence.
But in these cases, and especially where they are required to
make a post-mortem examination, it is just, in consequence of
the time, labor and skill required, and the responsibility and
risk they incur, that the public should award them a proper
honorarium.</p>

<p>§ 3. There is no profession, by the members of which, eleemosynary
services are more liberally dispensed, than the medical,
but justice requires that some limits should be placed to the
performance of such good offices. Poverty, professional brotherhood,
and certain public duties referred to in section 1 of this
chapter, should always be recognized as presenting valid claims
for gratuitous services; but neither institutions endowed by the
public or by rich individuals, societies for mutual benefit, for the
insurance of lives or for analogous purposes, nor any profession
or occupation, can be admitted to possess such privilege. Nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
can it be justly expected of physicians to furnish certificates of
inability to serve on juries, to perform militia duty, or to testify
to the state of health of persons wishing to insure their lives,
obtain pensions, or the like, without a pecuniary acknowledgment.
But to individuals in indigent circumstances, such professional
services should always be cheerfully and freely accorded.</p>

<p>§ 4. It is the duty of physicians, who are frequent witnesses
of the enormities committed by quackery, and the injury to
health and even destruction of life caused by the use of quack
medicines, to enlighten the public on these subjects, to expose
the injuries sustained by the unwary from the devices and pretensions
of artful empirics and impostors. Physicians ought to
use all the influence which they may possess, as professors in
Colleges of Pharmacy, and by exercising their option in regard
to the shops to which their prescriptions shall be sent, to discourage
druggists and apothecaries from vending quack or secret
medicines, or from being in any way engaged in their manufacture
and sale.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span>—<em>Obligations of the public to physicians.</em></p>

<p>§ 1. The benefits accruing to the public directly and indirectly
from the active and unwearied beneficence of the profession,
are so numerous and important, that physicians are justly entitled
to the utmost consideration and respect from the community.
The public ought likewise to entertain a just appreciation of
medical qualifications; to make a proper discrimination between
true science and the assumptions of ignorance and empiricism,—to
afford every encouragement and facility for the acquisition
of medical education,—and no longer to allow the statute books
to exhibit the anomaly of exacting knowledge from physicians,
under liability to heavy penalties, and of making them obnoxious
to punishment for resorting to the only means of obtaining it.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
